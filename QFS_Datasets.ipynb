I\\nfancy I've made MUDDLE what it is today. Frankly, I question the\\nwisdom of placing you in charge of such a sensitive desk, even for two\\nweeks. But remember. Yours is purely a rubber-stamp function.\\\"\\n\\\"In that case, let's leave it to Miss Furkle. I'll take a couple of\\nweeks off myself. With her poundage, she could bring plenty of pressure\\nto bear.\\\"\\n\\\"I assume you jest, Retief,\\\" Magnan said sadly. \\\"I should expect even\\nyou to appreciate that Bogan participation in the Exchange Program may\\nbe the first step toward sublimation of their aggressions into more\\ncultivated channels.\\\"\\n\\\"I see they're sending two thousand students to d'Land,\\\" Retief said,\\nglancing at the Memo for Record. \\\"That's a sizable sublimation.\\\"\\nMagnan nodded. \\\"The Bogans have launched no less than four military\\ncampaigns in the last two decades. They're known as the Hoodlums of\\nthe Nicodemean Cluster. Now, perhaps, we shall see them breaking that\\nprecedent and entering into the cultural life of the Galaxy.\\\"\\n\\\"Breaking and entering,\\\" Retief said. \\\"You may have something there.\\nBut I'm wondering what they'll study on d'Land. That's an industrial\\nworld of the poor but honest variety.\\\"\\n\\\"Academic details are the affair of the students and their professors,\\\"\\nMagnan said. \\\"Our function is merely to bring them together. See\\nthat you don't antagonize the Bogan representative. This will\\nbe an excellent opportunity for you to practice your diplomatic\\nrestraint\\u2014not your strong point, I'm sure you'll agree.\\\"\\nA buzzer sounded. Retief punched a button. \\\"What is it, Miss Furkle?\\\"\\n\\\"That\\u2014bucolic person from Lovenbroy is here again.\\\" On the small desk\\nscreen, Miss Furkle's meaty features were compressed in disapproval.\\n\\\"This fellow's a confounded pest. I'll leave him to you, Retief,\\\"\\nMagnan said. \\\"Tell him something. Get rid of him. And remember: here\\nat Corps HQ, all eyes are upon you.\\\"\\n\\\"If I'd thought of that, I'd have worn my other suit,\\\" Retief said.\\nMagnan snorted and passed from view. Retief punched Miss Furkle's\\nbutton.\\n\\\"Send the bucolic person in.\\\"\\nA tall broad man with bronze skin and gray hair, wearing tight trousers\\nof heavy cloth, a loose shirt open at the neck and a short jacket,\\nstepped into the room. He had a bundle under his arm. He paused at\\nsight of Retief, looked him over momentarily, then advanced and held\\nout his hand. Retief took it. For a moment the two big men stood, face\\nto face. The newcomer's jaw muscles knotted. Then he winced.\\nRetief dropped his hand and motioned to a chair.\\n\\\"That's nice knuckle work, mister,\\\" the stranger said, massaging his\\nhand. \\\"First time anybody ever did that to me. My fault though. I\\nstarted it, I guess.\\\" He grinned and sat down.\\n\\\"What can I do for you?\\\" Retief said.\\n\\\"You work for this Culture bunch, do you? Funny. I thought they were\\nall ribbon-counter boys. Never mind. I'm Hank Arapoulous. I'm a farmer.\\nWhat I wanted to see you about was\\u2014\\\" He shifted in his chair. \\\"Well,\\nout on Lovenbroy we've got a serious problem. The wine crop is just\\nabout ready. We start picking in another two, three months. Now I don't\\nknow if you're familiar with the Bacchus vines we grow...?\\\"\\n\\\"No,\\\" Retief said. \\\"Have a cigar?\\\" He pushed a box across the desk.\\nArapoulous took one. \\\"Bacchus vines are an unusual crop,\\\" he said,\\npuffing the cigar alight. \\\"Only mature every twelve years. In between,\\nthe vines don't need a lot of attention, so our time's mostly our own.\\nWe like to farm, though. Spend a lot of time developing new forms.\\nApples the size of a melon\\u2014and sweet\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Sounds very pleasant,\\\" Retief said. \\\"Where does the Libraries and\\nEducation Division come in?\\\"\\nArapoulous leaned forward. \\\"We go in pretty heavy for the arts. Folks\\ncan't spend all their time hybridizing plants. We've turned all the\\nland area we've got into parks and farms. Course, we left some sizable\\nforest areas for hunting and such. Lovenbroy's a nice place, Mr.\\nRetief.\\\"\\n\\\"It sounds like it, Mr. Arapoulous. Just what\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Call me Hank. We've got long seasons back home. Five of 'em. Our\\nyear's about eighteen Terry months. Cold as hell in winter; eccentric\\norbit, you know. Blue-black sky, stars visible all day. We do mostly\\npainting and sculpture in the winter. Then Spring; still plenty cold.\\nLots of skiing, bob-sledding, ice skating; and it's the season for\\nwoodworkers. Our furniture\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I've seen some of your furniture,\\\" Retief said. \\\"Beautiful work.\\\"\\nArapoulous nodded. \\\"All local timbers too. Lots of metals in our soil\\nand those sulphates give the woods some color, I'll tell you. Then\\ncomes the Monsoon. Rain\\u2014it comes down in sheets. But the sun's getting\\ncloser. Shines all the time. Ever seen it pouring rain in the sunshine?\\nThat's the music-writing season. Then summer. Summer's hot. We stay\\ninside in the daytime and have beach parties all night. Lots of beach\\non Lovenbroy; we're mostly islands. That's the drama and symphony time.\\nThe theatres are set up on the sand, or anchored off-shore. You have\\nthe music and the surf and the bonfires and stars\\u2014we're close to the\\ncenter of a globular cluster, you know....\\\"\\n\\\"You say it's time now for the wine crop?\\\"\\n\\\"That's right. Autumn's our harvest season. Most years we have just the\\nordinary crops. Fruit, grain, that kind of thing; getting it in doesn't\\ntake long. We spend most of the time on architecture, getting new\\nplaces ready for the winter or remodeling the older ones. We spend a\\nlot of time in our houses. We like to have them comfortable. But this\\nyear's different. This is Wine Year.\\\"\\nArapoulous puffed on his cigar, looked worriedly at Retief. \\\"Our wine\\ncrop is our big money crop,\\\" he said. \\\"We make enough to keep us going.\\nBut this year....\\\"\\n\\\"The crop isn't panning out?\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, the crop's fine. One of the best I can remember. Course, I'm only\\ntwenty-eight; I can't remember but two other harvests. The problem's\\nnot the crop.\\\"\\n\\\"Have you lost your markets? That sounds like a matter for the\\nCommercial\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Lost our markets? Mister, nobody that ever tasted our wines ever\\nsettled for anything else!\\\"\\n\\\"It sounds like I've been missing something,\\\" said Retief. \\\"I'll have\\nto try them some time.\\\"\\nArapoulous put his bundle on the desk, pulled off the wrappings. \\\"No\\ntime like the present,\\\" he said.\\nRetief looked at the two squat bottles, one green, one amber, both\\ndusty, with faded labels, and blackened corks secured by wire.\\n\\\"Drinking on duty is frowned on in the Corps, Mr. Arapoulous,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"This isn't\\ndrinking\\n. It's just wine.\\\" Arapoulous pulled the wire\\nretainer loose, thumbed the cork. It rose slowly, then popped in the\\nair. Arapoulous caught it. Aromatic fumes wafted from the bottle.\\n\\\"Besides, my feelings would be hurt if you didn't join me.\\\" He winked.\\nRetief took two thin-walled glasses from a table beside the desk. \\\"Come\\nto think of it, we also have to be careful about violating quaint\\nnative customs.\\\"\\nArapoulous filled the glasses. Retief picked one up, sniffed the deep\\nrust-colored fluid, tasted it, then took a healthy swallow. He looked\\nat Arapoulous thoughtfully.\\n\\\"Hmmm. It tastes like salted pecans, with an undercurrent of crusted\\nport.\\\"\\n\\\"Don't try to describe it, Mr. Retief,\\\" Arapoulous said. He took a\\nmouthful of wine, swished it around his teeth, swallowed. \\\"It's Bacchus\\nwine, that's all. Nothing like it in the Galaxy.\\\" He pushed the second\\nbottle toward Retief. \\\"The custom back home is to alternate red wine\\nand black.\\\"\\nRetief put aside his cigar, pulled the wires loose, nudged the cork,\\ncaught it as it popped up.\\n\\\"Bad luck if you miss the cork,\\\" Arapoulous said, nodding. \\\"You\\nprobably never heard about the trouble we had on Lovenbroy a few years\\nback?\\\"\\n\\\"Can't say that I did, Hank.\\\" Retief poured the black wine into two\\nfresh glasses. \\\"Here's to the harvest.\\\"\\n\\\"We've got plenty of minerals on Lovenbroy,\\\" Arapoulous said,\\nswallowing wine. \\\"But we don't plan to wreck the landscape mining 'em.\\nWe like to farm. About ten years back some neighbors of ours landed a\\nforce. They figured they knew better what to do with our minerals than\\nwe did. Wanted to strip-mine, smelt ore. We convinced 'em otherwise.\\nBut it took a year, and we lost a lot of men.\\\"\\n\\\"That's too bad,\\\" Retief said. \\\"I'd say this one tastes more like roast\\nbeef and popcorn over a Riesling base.\\\"\\n\\\"It put us in a bad spot,\\\" Arapoulous went on. \\\"We had to borrow\\nmoney from a world called Croanie. Mortgaged our crops. Had to start\\nexporting art work too. Plenty of buyers, but it's not the same when\\nyou're doing it for strangers.\\\"\\n\\\"Say, this business of alternating drinks is the real McCoy,\\\" Retief\\nsaid. \\\"What's the problem? Croanie about to foreclose?\\\"\\n\\\"Well, the loan's due. The wine crop would put us in the clear. But\\nwe need harvest hands. Picking Bacchus grapes isn't a job you can\\nturn over to machinery\\u2014and anyway we wouldn't if we could. Vintage\\nseason is the high point of living on Lovenbroy. Everybody joins in.\\nFirst, there's the picking in the fields. Miles and miles of vineyards\\ncovering the mountain sides, and crowding the river banks, with gardens\\nhere and there. Big vines, eight feet high, loaded with fruit, and deep\\ngrass growing between. The wine-carriers keep on the run, bringing wine\\nto the pickers. There's prizes for the biggest day's output, bets on\\nwho can fill the most baskets in an hour.... The sun's high and bright,\\nand it's just cool enough to give you plenty of energy. Come nightfall,\\nthe tables are set up in the garden plots, and the feast is laid on:\\nroast turkeys, beef, hams, all kinds of fowl. Big salads. Plenty of\\nfruit. Fresh-baked bread ... and wine, plenty of wine. The cooking's\\ndone by a different crew each night in each garden, and there's prizes\\nfor the best crews.\\n\\\"Then the wine-making. We still tramp out the vintage. That's mostly\\nfor the young folks but anybody's welcome. That's when things start to\\nget loosened up. Matter of fact, pretty near half our young-uns are\\nborn after a vintage. All bets are off then. It keeps a fellow on his\\ntoes though. Ever tried to hold onto a gal wearing nothing but a layer\\nof grape juice?\\\"\\n\\\"Never did,\\\" Retief said. \\\"You say most of the children are born after\\na vintage. That would make them only twelve years old by the time\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, that's Lovenbroy years; they'd be eighteen, Terry reckoning.\\\"\\n\\\"I was thinking you looked a little mature for twenty-eight,\\\" Retief\\nsaid.\\n\\\"Forty-two, Terry years,\\\" Arapoulous said. \\\"But this year it looks bad.\\nWe've got a bumper crop\\u2014and we're short-handed. If we don't get a big\\nvintage, Croanie steps in. Lord knows what they'll do to the land. Then\\nnext vintage time, with them holding half our grape acreage\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"You hocked the vineyards?\\\"\\n\\\"Yep. Pretty dumb, huh? But we figured twelve years was a long time.\\\"\\n\\\"On the whole,\\\" Retief said, \\\"I think I prefer the black. But the red\\nis hard to beat....\\\"\\n\\\"What we figured was, maybe you Culture boys could help us out. A loan\\nto see us through the vintage, enough to hire extra hands. Then we'd\\nrepay it in sculpture, painting, furniture\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Sorry, Hank. All we do here is work out itineraries for traveling\\nside-shows, that kind of thing. Now, if you needed a troop of Groaci\\nnose-flute players\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Can they pick grapes?\\\"\\n\\\"Nope. Anyway, they can't stand the daylight. Have you talked this over\\nwith the Labor Office?\\\"\\n\\\"Sure did. They said they'd fix us up with all the electronics\\nspecialists and computer programmers we wanted\\u2014but no field hands.\\nSaid it was what they classified as menial drudgery; you'd have thought\\nI was trying to buy slaves.\\\"\\nThe buzzer sounded. Miss Furkle's features appeared on the desk screen.\\n\\\"You're due at the Intergroup Council in five minutes,\\\" she said. \\\"Then\\nafterwards, there are the Bogan students to meet.\\\"\\n\\\"Thanks.\\\" Retief finished his glass, stood. \\\"I have to run, Hank,\\\" he\\nsaid. \\\"Let me think this over. Maybe I can come up with something.\\nCheck with me day after tomorrow. And you'd better leave the bottles\\nhere. Cultural exhibits, you know.\\\"\\nII\\nAs the council meeting broke up, Retief caught the eye of a colleague\\nacross the table.\\n\\\"Mr. Whaffle, you mentioned a shipment going to a place called Croanie.\\nWhat are they getting?\\\"\\nWhaffle blinked. \\\"You're the fellow who's filling in for Magnan, over\\nat MUDDLE,\\\" he said. \\\"Properly speaking, equipment grants are the\\nsole concern of the Motorized Equipment Depot, Division of Loans and\\nExchanges.\\\" He pursed his lips. \\\"However, I suppose there's no harm in\\ntelling you. They'll be receiving heavy mining equipment.\\\"\\n\\\"Drill rigs, that sort of thing?\\\"\\n\\\"Strip mining gear.\\\" Whaffle took a slip of paper from a breast pocket,\\nblinked at it. \\\"Bolo Model WV/1 tractors, to be specific. Why is MUDDLE\\ninterested in MEDDLE's activities?\\\"\\n\\\"Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Whaffle. It's just that Croanie cropped up\\nearlier today. It seems she holds a mortgage on some vineyards over\\non\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"That's not MEDDLE's affair, sir,\\\" Whaffle cut in. \\\"I have sufficient\\nproblems as Chief of MEDDLE without probing into MUDDLE'S business.\\\"\\n\\\"Speaking of tractors,\\\" another man put in, \\\"we over at the Special\\nCommittee for Rehabilitation and Overhaul of Under-developed Nations'\\nGeneral Economies have been trying for months to get a request for\\nmining equipment for d'Land through MEDDLE\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"SCROUNGE was late on the scene,\\\" Whaffle said. \\\"First come, first\\nserved. That's our policy at MEDDLE. Good day, gentlemen.\\\" He strode\\noff, briefcase under his arm.\\n\\\"That's the trouble with peaceful worlds,\\\" the SCROUNGE committeeman\\nsaid. \\\"Boge is a troublemaker, so every agency in the Corps is out\\nto pacify her. While my chance to make a record\\u2014that is, assist\\npeace-loving d'Land\\u2014comes to naught.\\\" He shook his head.\\n\\\"What kind of university do they have on d'Land?\\\" asked Retief. \\\"We're\\nsending them two thousand exchange students. It must be quite an\\ninstitution.\\\"\\n\\\"University? D'Land has one under-endowed technical college.\\\"\\n\\\"Will all the exchange students be studying at the Technical College?\\\"\\n\\\"Two thousand students? Hah! Two\\nhundred\\nstudents would overtax the\\nfacilities of the college.\\\"\\n\\\"I wonder if the Bogans know that?\\\"\\n\\\"The Bogans? Why, most of d'Land's difficulties are due to the unwise\\ntrade agreement she entered into with Boge. Two thousand students\\nindeed!\\\" He snorted and walked away.\\nRetief stopped by the office to pick up a short cape, then rode the\\nelevator to the roof of the 230-story Corps HQ building and hailed a\\ncab to the port. The Bogan students had arrived early. Retief saw them\\nlined up on the ramp waiting to go through customs. It would be half\\nan hour before they were cleared through. He turned into the bar and\\nordered a beer.\\nA tall young fellow on the next stool raised his glass.\\n\\\"Happy days,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"And nights to match.\\\"\\n\\\"You said it.\\\" He gulped half his beer. \\\"My name's Karsh. Mr. Karsh.\\nYep, Mr. Karsh. Boy, this is a drag, sitting around this place\\nwaiting....\\\"\\n\\\"You meeting somebody?\\\"\\n\\\"Yeah. Bunch of babies. Kids. How they expect\\u2014Never mind. Have one on\\nme.\\\"\\n\\\"Thanks. You a Scoutmaster?\\\"\\n\\\"I'll tell you what I am. I'm a cradle-robber. You know\\u2014\\\" he turned\\nto Retief\\u2014\\\"not one of those kids is over eighteen.\\\" He hiccupped.\\n\\\"Students, you know. Never saw a student with a beard, did you?\\\"\\n\\\"Lots of times. You're meeting the students, are you?\\\"\\nThe young fellow blinked at Retief. \\\"Oh, you know about it, huh?\\\"\\n\\\"I represent MUDDLE.\\\"\\nKarsh finished his beer, ordered another. \\\"I came on ahead. Sort of\\nan advance guard for the kids. I trained 'em myself. Treated it like\\na game, but they can handle a CSU. Don't know how they'll act under\\npressure. If I had my old platoon\\u2014\\\"\\nHe looked at his beer glass, pushed it back. \\\"Had enough,\\\" he said. \\\"So\\nlong, friend. Or are you coming along?\\\"\\nRetief nodded. \\\"Might as well.\\\"\\nAt the exit to the Customs enclosure, Retief watched as the first of\\nthe Bogan students came through, caught sight of Karsh and snapped to\\nattention, his chest out.\\n\\\"Drop that, mister,\\\" Karsh snapped. \\\"Is that any way for a student to\\nact?\\\"\\nThe youth, a round-faced lad with broad shoulders, grinned.\\n\\\"Heck, no,\\\" he said. \\\"Say, uh, Mr. Karsh, are we gonna get to go to\\ntown? We fellas were thinking\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"You were, hah? You act like a bunch of school kids! I mean ... no! Now\\nline up!\\\"\\n\\\"We have quarters ready for the students,\\\" Retief said. \\\"If you'd like\\nto bring them around to the west side, I have a couple of copters laid\\non.\\\"\\n\\\"Thanks,\\\" said Karsh. \\\"They'll stay here until take-off time. Can't\\nhave the little dears wandering around loose. Might get ideas about\\ngoing over the hill.\\\" He hiccupped. \\\"I mean they might play hookey.\\\"\\n\\\"We've scheduled your re-embarkation for noon tomorrow. That's a long\\nwait. MUDDLE's arranged theater tickets and a dinner.\\\"\\n\\\"Sorry,\\\" Karsh said. \\\"As soon as the baggage gets here, we're off.\\\" He\\nhiccupped again. \\\"Can't travel without our baggage, y'know.\\\"\\n\\\"Suit yourself,\\\" Retief said. \\\"Where's the baggage now?\\\"\\n\\\"Coming in aboard a Croanie lighter.\\\"\\n\\\"Maybe you'd like to arrange for a meal for the students here.\\\"\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" Karsh said. \\\"That's a good idea. Why don't you join us?\\\" Karsh\\nwinked. \\\"And bring a few beers.\\\"\\n\\\"Not this time,\\\" Retief said. He watched the students, still emerging\\nfrom Customs. \\\"They seem to be all boys,\\\" he commented. \\\"No female\\nstudents?\\\"\\n\\\"Maybe later,\\\" Karsh said. \\\"You know, after we see how the first bunch\\nis received.\\\"\\nBack at the MUDDLE office, Retief buzzed Miss Furkle.\\n\\\"Do you know the name of the institution these Bogan students are bound\\nfor?\\\"\\n\\\"Why, the University at d'Land, of course.\\\"\\n\\\"Would that be the Technical College?\\\"\\nMiss Furkle's mouth puckered. \\\"I'm sure I've never pried into these\\ndetails.\\\"\\n\\\"Where does doing your job stop and prying begin, Miss Furkle?\\\" Retief\\nsaid. \\\"Personally, I'm curious as to just what it is these students are\\ntravelling so far to study\\u2014at Corps expense.\\\"\\n\\\"Mr. Magnan never\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"For the present. Miss Furkle, Mr. Magnan is vacationing. That leaves\\nme with the question of two thousand young male students headed for\\na world with no classrooms for them ... a world in need of tractors.\\nBut the tractors are on their way to Croanie, a world under obligation\\nto Boge. And Croanie holds a mortgage on the best grape acreage on\\nLovenbroy.\\\"\\n\\\"Well!\\\" Miss Furkle snapped, small eyes glaring under unplucked brows.\\n\\\"I hope you're not questioning Mr. Magnan's wisdom!\\\"\\n\\\"About Mr. Magnan's wisdom there can be no question,\\\" Retief said. \\\"But\\nnever mind. I'd like you to look up an item for me. How many tractors\\nwill Croanie be getting under the MEDDLE program?\\\"\\n\\\"Why, that's entirely MEDDLE business,\\\" Miss Furkle said. \\\"Mr. Magnan\\nalways\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I'm sure he did. Let me know about the tractors as soon as you can.\\\"\\nMiss Furkle sniffed and disappeared from the screen. Retief left the\\noffice, descended forty-one stories, followed a corridor to the Corps\\nLibrary. In the stacks he thumbed through catalogues, pored over\\nindices.\\n\\\"Can I help you?\\\" someone chirped. A tiny librarian stood at his elbow.\\n\\\"Thank you, ma'am,\\\" Retief said. \\\"I'm looking for information on a\\nmining rig. A Bolo model WV tractor.\\\"\\n\\\"You won't find it in the industrial section,\\\" the librarian said.\\n\\\"Come along.\\\" Retief followed her along the stacks to a well-lit\\nsection lettered ARMAMENTS. She took a tape from the shelf, plugged\\nit into the viewer, flipped through and stopped at a squat armored\\nvehicle.\\n\\\"That's the model WV,\\\" she said. \\\"It's what is known as a continental\\nsiege unit. It carries four men, with a half-megaton/second firepower.\\\"\\n\\\"There must be an error somewhere,\\\" Retief said. \\\"The Bolo model I want\\nis a tractor. Model WV M-1\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, the modification was the addition of a bulldozer blade for\\ndemolition work. That must be what confused you.\\\"\\n\\\"Probably\\u2014among other things. Thank you.\\\"\\nMiss Furkle was waiting at the office. \\\"I have the information you\\nwanted,\\\" she said. \\\"I've had it for over ten minutes. I was under the\\nimpression you needed it urgently, and I went to great lengths\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" Retief said. \\\"Shoot. How many tractors?\\\"\\n\\\"Five hundred.\\\"\\n\\\"Are you sure?\\\"\\nMiss Furkle's chins quivered. \\\"Well! If you feel I'm incompetent\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Just questioning the possibility of a mistake, Miss Furkle. Five\\nhundred tractors is a lot of equipment.\\\"\\n\\\"Was there anything further?\\\" Miss Furkle inquired frigidly.\\n\\\"I sincerely hope not,\\\" Retief said.\\nIII\\nLeaning back in Magnan's padded chair with power swivel and\\nhip-u-matic concontour, Retief leafed through a folder labelled \\\"CERP\\n7-602-Ba; CROANIE (general).\\\" He paused at a page headed Industry.\\nStill reading, he opened the desk drawer, took out the two bottles of\\nBacchus wine and two glasses. He poured an inch of wine into each and\\nsipped the black wine meditatively.\\nIt would be a pity, he reflected, if anything should interfere with the\\nproduction of such vintages....\\nHalf an hour later he laid the folder aside, keyed the phone and put\\nthrough a call to the Croanie Legation. He asked for the Commercial\\nAttache.\\n\\\"Retief here, Corps HQ,\\\" he said airily. \\\"About the MEDDLE shipment,\\nthe tractors. I'm wondering if there's been a slip up. My records show\\nwe're shipping five hundred units....\\\"\\n\\\"That's correct. Five hundred.\\\"\\nRetief waited.\\n\\\"Ah ... are you there, Retief?\\\"\\n\\\"I'm still here. And I'm still wondering about the five hundred\\ntractors.\\\"\\n\\\"It's perfectly in order. I thought it was all settled. Mr. Whaffle\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"One unit would require a good-sized plant to handle its output,\\\"\\nRetief said. \\\"Now Croanie subsists on her fisheries. She has perhaps\\nhalf a dozen pint-sized processing plants. Maybe, in a bind, they\\ncould handle the ore ten WV's could scrape up ... if Croanie had any\\nore. It doesn't. By the way, isn't a WV a poor choice as a mining\\noutfit? I should think\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"See here, Retief! Why all this interest in a few surplus tractors?\\nAnd in any event, what business is it of yours how we plan to use the\\nequipment? That's an internal affair of my government. Mr. Whaffle\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I'm not Mr. Whaffle. What are you going to do with the other four\\nhundred and ninety tractors?\\\"\\n\\\"I understood the grant was to be with no strings attached!\\\"\\n\\\"I know it's bad manners to ask questions. It's an old diplomatic\\ntradition that any time you can get anybody to accept anything as a\\ngift, you've scored points in the game. But if Croanie has some scheme\\ncooking\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Nothing like that, Retief. It's a mere business transaction.\\\"\\n\\\"What kind of business do you do with a Bolo WV? With or without a\\nblade attached, it's what's known as a continental siege unit.\\\"\\n\\\"Great Heavens, Retief! Don't jump to conclusions! Would you have us\\nbranded as warmongers? Frankly\\u2014is this a closed line?\\\"\\n\\\"Certainly. You may speak freely.\\\"\\n\\\"The tractors are for transshipment. We've gotten ourselves into a\\ndifficult situation, balance-of-payments-wise. This is an accommodation\\nto a group with which we have rather strong business ties.\\\"\\n\\\"I understand you hold a mortgage on the best land on Lovenbroy,\\\"\\nRetief said. \\\"Any connection?\\\"\\n\\\"Why ... ah ... no. Of course not, ha ha.\\\"\\n\\\"Who gets the tractors eventually?\\\"\\n\\\"Retief, this is unwarranted interference!\\\"\\n\\\"Who gets them?\\\"\\n\\\"They happen to be going to Lovenbroy. But I scarcely see\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"And who's the friend you're helping out with an unauthorized\\ntransshipment of grant material?\\\"\\n\\\"Why ... ah ... I've been working with a Mr. Gulver, a Bogan\\nrepresentative.\\\"\\n\\\"And when will they be shipped?\\\"\\n\\\"Why, they went out a week ago. They'll be half way there by now. But\\nlook here, Retief, this isn't what you're thinking!\\\"\\n\\\"How do you know what I'm thinking? I don't know myself.\\\" Retief rang\\noff, buzzed the secretary.\\n\\\"Miss Furkle, I'd like to be notified immediately of any new\\napplications that might come in from the Bogan Consulate for placement\\nof students.\\\"\\n\\\"Well, it happens, by coincidence, that I have an application here now.\\nMr. Gulver of the Consulate brought it in.\\\"\\n\\\"Is Mr. Gulver in the office? I'd like to see him.\\\"\\n\\\"I'll ask him if he has time.\\\"\\n\\\"Great. Thanks.\\\" It was half a minute before a thick-necked red-faced\\nman in a tight hat walked in. He wore an old-fashioned suit, a drab\\nshirt, shiny shoes with round toes and an ill-tempered expression.\\n\\\"What is it you wish?\\\" he barked. \\\"I understood in my discussions with\\nthe other ... ah ... civilian there'd be no further need for these\\nirritating conferences.\\\"\\n\\\"I've just learned you're placing more students abroad, Mr. Gulver. How\\nmany this time?\\\"\\n\\\"Two thousand.\\\"\\n\\\"And where will they be going?\\\"\\n\\\"Croanie. It's all in the application form I've handed in. Your job is\\nto provide transportation.\\\"\\n\\\"Will there be any other students embarking this season?\\\"\\n\\\"Why ... perhaps. That's Boge's business.\\\" Gulver looked at Retief with\\npursed lips. \\\"As a matter of fact, we had in mind dispatching another\\ntwo thousand to Featherweight.\\\"\\n\\\"Another under-populated world\\u2014and in the same cluster, I believe,\\\"\\nRetief said. \\\"Your people must be unusually interested in that region\\nof space.\\\"\\n\\\"If that's all you wanted to know, I'll be on my way. I have matters of\\nimportance to see to.\\\"\\nAfter Gulver left, Retief called Miss Furkle in. \\\"I'd like to have a\\nbreak-out of all the student movements that have been planned under the\\npresent program,\\\" he said. \\\"And see if you can get a summary of what\\nMEDDLE has been shipping lately.\\\"\\nMiss Furkle compressed her lips. \\\"If Mr. Magnan were here, I'm sure\\nhe wouldn't dream of interfering in the work of other departments.\\nI ... overheard your conversation with the gentleman from the Croanie\\nLegation\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"The lists, Miss Furkle.\\\"\\n\\\"I'm not accustomed,\\\" Miss Furkle said, \\\"to intruding in matters\\noutside our interest cluster.\\\"\\n\\\"That's worse than listening in on phone conversations, eh? But never\\nmind. I need the information, Miss Furkle.\\\"\\n\\\"Loyalty to my Chief\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Loyalty to your pay-check should send you scuttling for the material\\nI've asked for,\\\" Retief said. \\\"I'm taking full responsibility. Now\\nscat.\\\"\\nThe buzzer sounded. Retief flipped a key. \\\"MUDDLE, Retief speaking....\\\"\\nArapoulous's brown face appeared on the desk screen.\\n\\\"How-do, Retief. Okay if I come up?\\\"\\n\\\"Sure, Hank. I want to talk to you.\\\"\\nIn the office, Arapoulous took a chair. \\\"Sorry if I'm rushing you,\\nRetief,\\\" he said. \\\"But have you got anything for me?\\\"\\nRetief waved at the wine bottles. \\\"What do you know about Croanie?\\\"\\n\\\"Croanie? Not much of a place. Mostly ocean. All right if you like\\nfish, I guess. We import our seafood from there. Nice prawns in monsoon\\ntime. Over a foot long.\\\"\\n\\\"You on good terms with them?\\\"\\n\\\"Sure, I guess so. Course, they're pretty thick with Boge.\\\"\\n\\\"So?\\\"\\n\\\"Didn't I tell you? Boge was the bunch that tried to take us over here\\na dozen years back. They'd've made it too, if they hadn't had a lot of\\nbad luck. Their armor went in the drink, and without armor they're easy\\ngame.\\\"\\nMiss Furkle buzzed. \\\"I have your lists,\\\" she said shortly.\\n\\\"Bring them in, please.\\\"\\nThe secretary placed the papers on the desk. Arapoulous caught her eye\\nand grinned. She sniffed and marched from the room.\\n\\\"What that gal needs is a slippery time in the grape mash,\\\" Arapoulous\\nobserved. Retief thumbed through the papers, pausing to read from time\\nto time. He finished and looked at Arapoulous.\\n\\\"How many men do you need for the harvest, Hank?\\\" Retief inquired.\\nArapoulous sniffed his wine glass and looked thoughtful.\\n\\\"A hundred would help,\\\" he said. \\\"A thousand would be better. Cheers.\\\"\\n\\\"What would you say to two thousand?\\\"\\n\\\"Two thousand?

They have a shortage of workers for the harvest due to their conflict over strip mining and the loss of several of their young men in the battles to prevent it.

He shares that they are indebted to Croanie, who loaned them funds after a failed invasion from the Bogans. Arapoulous is worried that the Croanie\\u2019s will be able to come in and harvest the grapes (as well as take the land) for themselves if they can\\u2019t pay the debt since they hold the mortgage on some of the acreage. After sharing some wine (alternating between red and black), Retief agrees to try and see if he can send some helping hands to Lovenbroy, Arapoulous\\u2019 home planet. \\n\\tRetief soon discovers that MEDDLE, another division at the Manpower Utilization Director, has authorized a shipment of 500 tractors that will be sent to Croanie. Retief questions Mr. Whaffle about it, and he explains that they are in need of heavy mining equipment. However, Croanie is mostly made up of fisheries, so there\\u2019s nothing to mine there. Retief questions other shipments as well, including the authorized transport of 2,000 Bogan students to d\\u2019Land. He discovers that there is only one technical college on d\\u2019Land and that it would be overwhelmed with just 200 transfer students.

Sensing something fishy, Retief continues his search. \\n\\tOn his way to greet the incoming students, Retief stops at a bar and meets their teacher, Mr. Karsh. He describes training them as if they were in the military, not as if they were students. They leave together to meet the students. Retief arranged for a variety of fun events for the students, but Mr. Karsh shuts it all down.

He speaks to Mr. Gulver, a Bogan representative, who reveals that he just submitted an application for transportation for another 2,000 students.

He reminds Retief of a group of students from the planet Boge who will be traveling to the planet d\\u2019Land as part of an Exchange Program. Magnan\\u2019s hope is this program will help the warring Bogans better assimilate into the Galaxy\\u2019s culture. While he is gone, Retief meets with a man named Hank Arapoulous, who represents a planet called Lovenbroy, known for its plentiful grape harvests. Over wine, Hank requests labor to harvest the crop essential to their livelihood on Lovenbroy, and Retief learns of their connection to a planet called Croanie. Several years ago, the farmers of Lovenbroy had to defend their mineral resources against their neighbors, and they lost a lot of money and men in the process. Therefore, they had to borrow money from Croanie, and Hank is afraid they won\\u2019t be able to pay their debt on time without enough hands to harvest their grape crop. In addition, in their desperation, the farmers of Lovenbroy pawned the mortgage of their vineyards to Croanie thinking the twelve-year crop rotation would buy them enough time to pay back their debts. Retief says he will try to find a solution to his problem, and he sets about to attend the Intergroup Council and meet with the Bogan students set to depart for d\\u2019Land. At the Council meeting, he learns Croanie is set to receive a shipment of mining equipment from the Corps, and the school on d\\u2019Land set to receive the 2,000 Bogan students could hardly accommodate 200. At a bar later, Retief meets a man named Karsh, who drunkenly reveals he is training the students for something other than studying. At the library later, Retief learns that the tractors being sent to Croanie are not mining equipment, but are heavily armored with firepower. When Retief questions why so many tractors are being sent to a planet without the capacity to process them, he learns the excess will be sent to Boge. Retief deduces the entire situation is a Bogan plot to send troops to d\\u2019Land and have Croanie provide the military equipment sourced from Corps grants. Instead, Retief has representatives from Armaments confiscate the students\\u2019 luggage (which are actually filled with guns) and sends the \\u201cstudents\\u201d to Lovenbroy instead, where they help the farmers harvest their grape crop.

This forced indoor time led to a very artistic culture springing up. Many spend the winters painting and sculpting. This necessary indoor time has made the Lovenbroy very keen on architecture. Spring is also pretty cold, but warm and light enough to woodwork and play a few sports. Then comes the season of music, where it rains all day but the sun constantly shines.

LUDWIG\\nIllustrated by THORNE\\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\\nGalaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nOne man's retreat is another's prison ... and\\nit takes a heap of flying to make a hulk a home!\\nForty days of heaven and forty nights of hell. That's the way it's\\nbeen, Laura. But how can I make you understand? How can I tell you\\nwhat it's like to be young and a man and to dream of reaching the\\nstars? And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing\\nfear\\u2014a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an\\nevil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\\nPerhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\\nIt was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos,\\nwere over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and\\nlaboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after\\nspawning its first-born.\\nFor it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class\\nof the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\\nThe\\nfirst\\ngraduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important,\\nbecause we were the\\nfirst\\n.\\nWe sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach\\nof faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New\\nMexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and\\ngrandparents and kid brothers and sisters\\u2014the people who a short time\\nago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken\\nwistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had\\nnever really existed.\\nBut today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us\\nwith pride in their eyes.\\nA voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \\\"... these boys have worked\\nhard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things.\\nThey're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately\\nneed. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land\\nthat will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most\\nimportant of all, they'll make other men think of the stars and look up\\nat them and feel humility\\u2014for mankind needs humility.\\\"\\nThe speaker was Robert Chandler, who'd brought the first rocket down on\\nMars just five years ago, who'd established the first colony there, and\\nwho had just returned from his second hop to Venus.\\nInstead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders\\nand his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth\\nand skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time,\\nfor I was thinking:\\nHe's already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the\\nothers alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the\\nfirst!\\nMickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \\\"I don't\\nsee 'em, Ben,\\\" he whispered. \\\"Where do you suppose they are?\\\"\\nI blinked. \\\"Who?\\\"\\n\\\"My folks.\\\"\\nThat was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in\\na strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those\\n\\\"You are cordially invited\\\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie\\nTaggart.\\nStardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a\\nveteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years\\nago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the\\nLunar\\nLady\\n, a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White\\nSands.\\nI remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island\\nSpaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like\\nme until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I\\nremembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\\nMy gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It\\nwasn't surprising. The\\nLunar Lady\\nwas in White Sands now, but\\nliberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars.\\nIt doesn't matter\\n, I told myself.\\nThen Mickey stiffened. \\\"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\\\"\\nUsually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a\\ngarden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a\\ntenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that\\nhe was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at\\nthe Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was\\nmighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only\\nhalf as big.\\nAnd then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we\\nwere gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw\\nthe stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each\\nlike a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by\\nthe sons of Earth.\\nThey expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of\\ncivilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and\\na hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do.\\nI felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared.\\nAt last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,\\nbabbling wave.\\nThen I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\\nHis wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining\\nlike a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear\\nrows.\\nBut he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and\\nold, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that\\nit was hard to believe he'd once been young.\\nHe scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\\n\\\"You made it, boy,\\\" he chortled, \\\"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate\\ntonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as\\ngood spacemen should!\\\"\\nThen Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,\\nwalking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm\\nwith some silent melody.\\nAnd you, Laura, were with him.\\n\\\"Meet the Brat,\\\" he said. \\\"My sister Laura.\\\"\\nI stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity\\nof your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a\\ngolden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes\\nof a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a\\ngentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\\n\\\"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\\\" you said. \\\"I've heard of no one else for\\nthe past year.\\\"\\nA tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an\\nintroduction of Charlie.\\nYou and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old\\nStardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie\\nscorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a\\nshiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol.\\nHis tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\\nAnd the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the\\nresult of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so\\naccustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I\\nknew, would find them ugly.\\nYou were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \\\"It's a privilege to\\nmeet you, Charlie. Just think\\u2014one of Everson's men, one of the first\\nto reach the Moon!\\\"\\nCharlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \\\"Still going to spend the\\nweekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\\\"\\nI shook my head. \\\"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're\\nplanning to see the town tonight.\\\"\\n\\\"Why don't you both come with us?\\\" you asked. \\\"Our folks have their\\nown plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room.\\nCharlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the\\nMoon?\\\"\\nCharlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew\\nthat he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian\\nfizzes and Plutonian zombies.\\nBut this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\\n\\\"We'd really like to come,\\\" I said.\\nOn our way to the 'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was\\na tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor\\nshould look.\\n\\\"Ben,\\\" he called, \\\"don't forget that offer. Remember you've got two\\nmonths to decide.\\\"\\n\\\"No, thanks,\\\" I answered. \\\"Better not count on me.\\\"\\nA moment later Mickey said, frowning, \\\"What was he talking about, Ben?\\nDid he make you an offer?\\\"\\nI laughed. \\\"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching\\nastrogation. What a life\\nthat\\nwould be! Imagine standing in a\\nclassroom for forty years when I've got the chance to\\u2014\\\"\\nI hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \\\"When you've got the\\nchance to be the first to reach a new planet. That's what most of you\\nwant, isn't it? That's what Mickey used to want.\\\"\\nI looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to\\nunderstand the hunger that could lie in a man's heart.\\nThen your last words came back and jabbed me: \\\"That's what Mickey used\\nto want.\\\"\\n\\\"\\nUsed\\nto want?\\\" I asked. \\\"What do you mean?\\\"\\nYou bit your lip, not answering.\\n\\\"What did she mean, Mickey?\\\"\\nMickey looked down at his feet. \\\"I didn't want to tell you yet, Ben.\\nWe've been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Yes?\\\"\\n\\\"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty\\nuniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If\\nyou're lucky, you're good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or\\nanother gets you. They don't insure rocketmen, you know.\\\"\\nMy stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \\\"What are you trying to\\nsay, Mickey?\\\"\\n\\\"I've thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor\\nof White Sands Port.\\\" He raised his hand to stop me. \\\"I know. It's not\\nso exciting. I'll just live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben.\\\"\\nI couldn't answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my\\nknees with the blast of a jet.\\n\\\"It doesn't change anything, Ben\\u2014right now, I mean. We can still have\\na good weekend.\\\"\\nCharlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to\\nreach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the\\n'copter.\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" I said to Mickey, \\\"we can still have a good weekend.\\\"\\nI liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.\\nThey were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,\\ndeep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was\\ncool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional\\nvideo, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or\\nhousework.\\nStardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a\\nshower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\\nAt the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \\\"Only hit\\nMars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.\\nSkipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,\\nthe medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid\\nin your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.\\nHell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\\\"\\nThat was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.\\nAfterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,\\nto watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally\\nstreaked up from White Sands.\\nWe gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:\\n\\\"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's\\nsort of funny.\\\"\\n\\\"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those\\ndays, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a\\nspaceman then.\\\"\\n\\\"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\\\"\\nI smiled and shook my head. \\\"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie\\ndoesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as\\nI know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\\\"\\nYou stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew\\nsuddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\\nThere was silence.\\nYou were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were\\nflecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the\\nfeeling that I shouldn't have come here.\\nYou kept looking at me until I had to ask: \\\"What are you thinking,\\nLaura?\\\"\\nYou laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \\\"No, I shouldn't be\\nthinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\\\"\\n\\\"I could never hate you.\\\"\\n\\\"It\\u2014it's about the stars,\\\" you said very softly. \\\"I understand why you\\nwant to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were\\nkids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I\\ndreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I\\nlived for months, just thinking about it.\\n\\\"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,\\nand the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I\\nrealized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting\\nbefore you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\\\"\\nI frowned. \\\"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think\\nmaybe I haven't grown up yet?\\\"\\nAnxiety darkened your features. \\\"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,\\nto see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it\\nworth the things you'd have to give up?\\\"\\nI didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \\\"Give up\\nwhat\\n?\\\"\\nThen I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\\nAll through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.\\nGovernment boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on\\nthe stars.\\nNow I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that\\nI'd never noticed before.\\nYou can go into space\\n, I thought,\\nand try to do as much living in\\nten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died\\nin a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie\\nburied in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like\\nCharlie\\u2014a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally\\nalone, never finding a home.\\nOr there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth\\nin cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with\\na wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow\\nold, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who\\nfill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous\\ndust.\\n\\\"I'm sorry,\\\" you said. \\\"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\\\"\\n\\\"It's all right,\\\" I said, clenching my fists. \\\"You made sense\\u2014a lot of\\nsense.\\\"\\nThe next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his\\nscarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin,\\ntight coughs.\\nThen he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \\\"I'm\\nleavin' that for you. It's full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought\\nmaybe you'd like to have 'em.\\\"\\nI scowled, not understanding. \\\"Why, Charlie? What for?\\\"\\nHe shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \\\"Oh,\\nit's just that I've been dodgin' meteors now for twenty-five years.\\nThat's a long time, boy. Ain't one spaceman in a thousand that lucky.\\nSome of these days, I won't be so lucky.\\\"\\nI tried to laugh. \\\"You're good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\\\"\\nHe shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \\\"Maybe. Anyway, I'm\\ngonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell\\nyou what. There's a little stone cafe on Mars, the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just\\noff Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a\\nlook inside. I'll probably be there.\\\"\\nHe coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears.\\n\\\"Not used to this Earth air,\\\" he muttered. \\\"What I need's some Martian\\nclimate.\\\"\\nSuddenly that cough frightened me. It didn't seem normal. I wondered,\\ntoo, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were\\ndrugged.\\nI shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk about\\ngoing to Mars. The medics wouldn't let him go even as far as Luna.\\nWe watched him leave, you and Mickey and I.\\n\\\"When will you be back?\\\" you asked.\\nCharlie's hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \\\"Maybe a\\ncouple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\\\"\\nThen he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man.\\nI wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill\\nthe doubt worming through my brain.\\nBut he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was\\ngone.\\nThat afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy's\\nroom than a spaceman's. In it were all the little things that kids\\ntreasure\\u2014pennants, models of Everson's two ships, a tennis trophy,\\nbooks, a home-made video.\\nI began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy.\\nI could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched\\ntheir children grow to adulthood.\\nI'd missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of\\nthem drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it\\nhad been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and\\nroutines and rules. I'd been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams,\\nI hadn't realized I was different.\\nMy folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren't for rockets, I'd\\nhave lived the kind of life a kid should live.\\nMickey noticed my frown.\\n\\\"What's the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm just\\nnot like you and Charlie, I guess. I\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"No, I understand, Mickey. I'm not sore, really.\\\"\\n\\\"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?\\\"\\n\\\"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the\\nOdyssey\\n, the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me,\\ntoo, for the Moon Patrol, but that's old stuff, not much better than\\nteaching. I want to be in deep space.\\\"\\n\\\"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy\\nEarth life while you can. Okay?\\\"\\nI felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted\\nsomeone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of\\ncourage that would put fuel on dying dreams.\\nBut I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the\\nflecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever\\nso slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as\\nmuch as I loved the stars.\\nAnd I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \\\"Sure,\\nI'll stay, Mickey. Sure.\\\"\\nForty days of joy, forty nights of fear and indecision. We did all the\\nlittle things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying\\ndown to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to\\nteach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon\\nand the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and\\npromise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\\nOne morning I thought,\\nWhy must I make a choice? Why can't I have both\\nyou and the stars? Would that be asking too much?\\nAll day the thought lay in my mind like fire.\\nThat evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \\\"Laura, I\\nwant you to be my wife.\\\"\\nYou looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face\\nflushed.\\nThen you murmured, \\\"I\\u2014I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me\\nto marry a spaceman or a teacher?\\\"\\n\\\"Can't a spaceman marry, too?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don't you see,\\nBen? You'd be like Charlie. Gone for\\nmaybe\\ntwo months,\\nmaybe\\ntwo\\nyears. Then you'd have a twenty-four hour liberty\\u2014and I'd have what?\\\"\\nSomehow I'd expected words like these, but still they hurt. \\\"I wouldn't\\nhave to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years,\\nthen teach.\\\"\\n\\\"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't\\nyou want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\\\"\\nYour voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears\\nglittering in your eyes.\\n\\\"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened\\non the\\nCyclops\\n. There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was\\nflooded with radiation\\u2014just for a second. It didn't seem serious. The\\nmen had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it\\nwas\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I know, Laura. Don't say it.\\\"\\nYou had to finish. \\\"It was a monster.\\\"\\nThat night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me\\nsleep.\\nYou've got to decide now\\n, I told myself.\\nYou can't stay here. You've\\ngot to make a choice.\\nThe teaching job was still open. The spot on the\\nOdyssey\\nwas still\\nopen\\u2014and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the\\nway to Pluto.\\nYou can take Dean Dawson's job and stay with Laura and have kids and a\\nhome and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now.\\nOr you can see what's on the other side of the mountain. You can be a\\nline in a history book.\\nI cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He'd say, \\\"Get the hell out\\nof there, boy. Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Get\\nout there on the\\nOdyssey\\nwhere you belong. We got a date on Mars,\\nremember? At the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just off Chandler Field on the Grand\\nCanal.\\\"\\nThat's what he'd say.\\nAnd yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.\\n\\\"Oh God,\\\" I moaned, \\\"what shall I do?\\\"\\nNext morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door and\\nbrought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered who\\ncould be sending me a message.\\nI pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping,\\nautomatic voice droned: \\\"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to\\ninform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\\\"\\nThen there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word\\n\\\"lung-rot\\\" and the metallic phrase, \\\"This message brought to you by\\ncourtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\\\"\\nI stood staring at the cylinder.\\nCharles Taggart was dead.\\nCharles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.\\nMy heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie!\\nThe audiogram had lied!\\nI pressed the stud again. \\\"... regret to inform you of death of\\nCharles ...\\\"\\nI hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken\\nvoice droned on.\\nYou ran to it, shut it off. \\\"I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly\\u2014\\\"\\nWithout answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I\\nremembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze.\\nThe metallic words had told the truth.\\nI sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at\\nCharlie's faded tin box.\\nThen, finally, I fingered his meager possessions\\u2014a few wrinkled\\nphotos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god,\\na gold service medal from the Moon Patrol.\\nThis was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space.\\nIt was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters\\ninstead of children, a medal instead of a home.\\nIt'd be a great future\\n, I thought.\\nYou'd dream of sitting in a dingy\\nstone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky,\\nstinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls\\nwith dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first\\nsign of lung-rot.\\nTo hell with it!\\nI walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.\\nI accepted that job teaching.\\nAnd now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,\\nand the house is silent.\\nIt's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\\nwriting this.\\nI looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\\nAnd among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\\nA wedding ring.\\nIn that past he never talked about, there was a woman\\u2014his wife.\\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\\u2014that there can be\\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\\nDo you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\\nman's dream.\\nHe made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\\nkind\\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\\nDo you know\\nwhy\\nhe wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\\nIt was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\\nbrothers, the planets his children.\\nYou say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\\nsure\\nuntil the journey is\\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\\nstar and think,\\nI might have gone there; I could have been the first\\n?\\nWe said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\\nCharlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\\nBecause of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\\nRight now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\\non Mars, the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\\nStardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\\nI have two wedding rings with me\\u2014his wife's ring and yours.\\n\",\n          \"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\\\"\\n    \\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\\\">\\nThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Home is Where You Left It, by Adam Chase\\n\\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nThe chance of mass slaughter was their eternal nightmare.\\nHow black is the blackest treachery? Is the most callous\\ntraitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?\\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\\nOnly the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\\nhe reached the village.\\nHe poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\\nHe walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\\nin a\\nKumaji\\nraid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\\ntime as a boy.\\nHe went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\\nHe hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\\nPoisoned.\\nHe spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\\nThe well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\\u2014too\\nlate for anything.\\nHe went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\\nscurried away.\\n\\\"Earthman!\\\" a quavering voice called.\\nSteve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\\nSteve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\\ncanteen and said:\\n\\\"What happened here?\\\"\\n\\\"They're gone. All gone.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, but what happened?\\\"\\n\\\"The Kumaji\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"You're Kumaji.\\\"\\n\\\"This is my town,\\\" the old man said. \\\"I lived with the Earthmen. Now\\nthey're gone.\\\"\\n\\\"But you stayed here\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"To die,\\\" the old man said, without self-pity. \\\"I'm too old to flee, too\\nold to fight, too old for anything but death. More water.\\\"\\nSteve gave him another drink. \\\"You still haven't told me what happened.\\\"\\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\\n\\\"When did it happen?\\\" Steve demanded.\\n\\\"Last night.\\\" It was now midafternoon. \\\"Three folks died,\\\" the Kumaji\\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \\\"from the poisoning of the well. The\\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\\\"\\n\\\"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\\\" Oasis City,\\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\\n\\\"They have to,\\\" the old man said. \\\"And they have to hurry. Men, women\\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\\\"\\nSteve felt irrational hatred then. He thought it would help if he could\\nfind some of the nomadic tribesmen and kill them. It might help the way\\nhe felt, he knew, but it certainly wouldn't help the fleeing colonists,\\ntrekking across a parched wilderness\\u2014to the safety of Oasis City\\u2014or\\ndeath.\\n\\\"Come on,\\\" Steve said, making up his mind. \\\"The unicopter can hold two\\nin a pinch.\\\"\\n\\\"You're going after them?\\\"\\n\\\"I've got to. They're my people. I've been away too long.\\\"\\n\\\"Say, you're young Cantwell, aren't you? Now I remember.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, I'm Steve Cantwell.\\\"\\n\\\"I'm not going anyplace, young fellow.\\\"\\n\\\"But you can't stay here, without any good water to drink, without\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I'm staying,\\\" the old man said, still without self-pity, just\\nmatter-of-factly. \\\"The Earth folks have no room for me and I can't blame\\n'em. The Kumaji'll kill me for a renegade, I figure. I lived a good,\\nlong life. I've no regrets. Go after your people, young fellow. They'll\\nneed every extra strong right arm they can get. You got any weapons?\\\"\\n\\\"No,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"Too bad. Well, good-bye and good luck.\\\"\\n\\\"But you can't\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, I'm staying. I want to stay. This is my home. It's the only home\\nI'll ever have. Good luck, young fellow.\\\"\\nSlowly, Steve walked to his unicopter. It was nothing more than a small\\nmetal disk on which to stand, and a shaft with four turbo-blades. It\\ncould do sixty miles an hour at an elevation of two thousand feet.\\nSteve turned the little turbo-jet engine over, then on impulse ran back\\nto the old man and gave him his canteen, turning away before it could be\\nrefused and striding quickly back to the unicopter and getting himself\\nairborne without looking at the deserted village or the old man again.\\nThe old man's voice called after him: \\\"Tell the people ... hurry ...\\nKumaji looking for them to kill ... desert wind ought to wipe out their\\ntrail ... but hurry....\\\"\\nThe voice faded into the faint rushing sound of the hot desert wind.\\nSteve gazed down on bare sun-blasted rock, on rippled dunes, on\\nhate-haze. He circled wider and wider, seeking his people.\\nHours later he spotted the caravan in the immensity of sand and\\nwasteland. He brought the unicopter down quickly, with a rush of air and\\na whine of turbojets. He alighted in the sand in front of the\\nslow-moving column. It was like something out of Earth's Middle\\nEast\\u2014and Middle Ages. They had even imported camels for their life here\\non the Sirian desert, deciding the Earth camel was a better beast of\\nburden than anything the Sirius II wastelands had to offer. They walked\\nbeside the great-humped beasts of burden, the animals piled high with\\nthe swaying baggage of their belongings. They moved through the sands\\nwith agonizing slowness. Already, after only one day's travel, Steve\\ncould see that some of the people were spent and exhausted and had to\\nride on camelback. They had gone perhaps fifteen miles, with almost five\\nhundred to go across searing desert, the Kumaji seeking them....\\n\\\"Hullo!\\\" Steve shouted, and a man armed with an atorifle came striding\\nclumsily through the sand toward him. \\\"Cantwell's the name,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"I'm one of you.\\\"\\nBleak hostility in his face, the man approached. \\\"Cantwell. Yeah, I\\nremember you. Colony wasn't good enough for young Steve Cantwell. Oh,\\nno. Had to go off to Earth to get himself educated. What are you doing\\nhere now on that fancy aircraft of yours, coming to crow at our wake?\\\"\\nThe bitterness surprised Steve. He recognized the man now as Tobias\\nWhiting, who had been the Colony's most successful man when Steve was a\\nboy. Except for his bitterness and for the bleak self-pity and defeat in\\nhis eyes, the years had been good to Tobias Whiting. He was probably in\\nhis mid-forties now, twenty years Steve's senior, but he was\\nwell-muscled, his flesh was solid, his step bold and strong. He was a\\nbig muscular man with a craggy, handsome face. In ten years he had\\nhardly changed at all, while Steve Cantwell, the boy, had become Steve\\nCantwell the man. He had been the Colony's official trader with the\\nKumajis, and had grown rich\\u2014by colony standards\\u2014at his business. Now,\\nSteve realized, all that was behind him, and he could only flee with the\\nothers\\u2014either back to the terribly crowded Earth or on in search of a\\nnew colony on some other outworld, if they could get the transportation.\\nPerhaps that explained his bitterness.\\n\\\"So you've come back, eh? You sure picked a time, Cantwell.\\\"\\nThe refugees were still about a quarter of a mile off, coming up slowly.\\nThey hardly seemed to be moving at all. \\\"Is my aunt all right?\\\" Steve\\nsaid. She was the only family he remembered.\\nTobias Whiting shook his head slowly. \\\"I hate to be the one to tell you\\nthis. Brace yourself for a shock. Your aunt was one of those who died\\nfrom the poisoned water last night.\\\"\\nFor a long moment, Steve said nothing. The only emotion he felt was\\npity\\u2014pity for the hard life his aunt had lived, and the hard death.\\nSadness would come later, if there was to be a time for sadness.\\nThe caravan reached them then. The first person Steve saw was a girl.\\nShe wore the shroud-like desert garment and her face\\u2014it would be a\\npretty face under other circumstances, Steve realized\\u2014was etched with\\nlines of fatigue. Steve did not recognize her. \\\"Who is he, Dad?\\\" the\\ngirl said.\\n\\\"Young Cantwell. Remember?\\\"\\nSo this was Mary Whiting, Steve thought. Why, she'd been a moppet ten\\nyears ago! How old? Ten years old maybe. The years crowded him suddenly.\\nShe was a woman now....\\n\\\"Steve Cantwell?\\\" Mary said. \\\"Of course I remember. Hello, Steve. I\\u2014I'm\\nsorry you had to come back at a time like this. I'm sorry about your\\naunt. If there's anything I can do....\\\"\\nSteve shook his head, then shook the hand she offered him. She was a\\nslim, strong girl with a firm handshake. Her concern for him at a time\\nlike this was little short of amazing, especially since it was\\ncompletely genuine.\\nHe appreciated it.\\nTobias Whiting said: \\\"Shame of it is, Cantwell, some of us could get\\nalong with the Kumaji. I had a pretty good business here, you know\\nthat.\\\" He looked with bitterness at the dusty file of refugees. \\\"But I\\nnever got a credit out of it. Wherever we wind up, my girl and I will be\\npoor again. We could have been rich.\\\"\\nSteve asked, \\\"What happened to all your profits?\\\"\\n\\\"Tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, but thanks to what happened I'll\\nnever see it again.\\\"\\nMary winced, as if her father's words and his self-pity were painful to\\nher. Then others came up and a few minutes were spent in back-pounding\\nand hand-shaking as some of the men who had been boys with Steve came up\\nto recognize and be recognized. Their greeting was warm, as Tobias\\nWhiting's had been cool. Despite the knowledge of what lay behind all of\\nthem, and what still lay ahead, it was a little like homecoming.\\nBut Steve liked Mary Whiting's warm, friendly smile best of all. It was\\ncomforting and reassuring.\\nThree days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared.\\nThe caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day.\\nTheir water supply was almost gone but on the fourth day they hoped to\\nreach an oasis in the desert. Two of the older folks had died of\\nfatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be\\ndone for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always\\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\\nbacks.\\nAnd then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\\nSteve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the\\nturbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but\\nhad assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had\\ndone so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji.\\n\\\"But why?\\\" someone asked. \\\"Why?\\\"\\nAt first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the\\nday before said: \\\"It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money\\u2014with the\\nKumaji.\\\"\\nNone of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying\\nanything, and Steve squeezed her hand.\\n\\\"Now, wait a minute,\\\" one of Whiting's friends said.\\n\\\"Wait, nothing.\\\" This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the\\ncolony. \\\"I know how Whiting's mind works. He slaved all his life for\\nthat money, that's the way he'll see it. Cantwell, didn't you say the\\nKumaji were looking for us, to kill us?\\\"\\n\\\"That's what I was told,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"All right,\\\" Gort went on relentlessly. \\\"Then this is what I figure must\\nhave happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally\\ndecided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's\\n'copter, determined to get it. Only catch is, folks, if I know the\\nKumaji, they won't just give it to him\\u2014not by a long sight.\\\"\\n\\\"No?\\\" someone asked.\\n\\\"No sir. They'll trade. For our location. And if Whiting went off like\\nthat without even saying good-bye to his girl here, my guess is he'll\\nmake the trade.\\\" His voice reflected some bitterness.\\nMary went to Gort and slapped his face. The elderly man did not even\\nblink. \\\"Well,\\\" he asked her gently, \\\"did your pa tell you he was going?\\\"\\n\\\"N-no,\\\" Mary said. There were tears in her eyes, but she did not cry.\\nGort turned to Steve. \\\"Cantwell, can he get far in that 'copter?\\\"\\nSteve shook his head. \\\"Ten or fifteen miles is all. Almost out of fuel,\\nMr. Gort. You saw how I took her up for only a quick mile swing each\\nday. He won't get far.\\\"\\n\\\"He'll crash in the desert?\\\"\\n\\\"Crash or crash-land,\\\" Steve said.\\nMary sobbed, and bit her lip, and was silent.\\n\\\"We've got to stop him,\\\" Gort said. \\\"And fast. If he gets to the Kumaji,\\nthey'll send down a raiding party and we'll be finished. We could never\\nfight them off without the protection of our village. Near as I can\\nfigure, there's a Kumaji base fifty miles due north of here. Whiting\\nknows it too, so that's where he'll be going, I figure. Can't spare more\\nthan a couple of men to look for him, though, in case the Kumaji find\\nus\\u2014or are led to us\\u2014and attack.\\\"\\nSteve said, \\\"I should have taken something out of the 'copter every\\nnight, so it couldn't start. I'll go.\\\"\\nMary came forward boldly. \\\"I have to go. He's my father. If he crashed\\nout there, he may be hurt. He may be\\u2014dying.\\\"\\nGort looked at her. \\\"And if he's trying to sell us out to the Kumajis?\\\"\\n\\\"Then\\u2014then I'll do whatever Steve asks me to. I promise.\\\"\\n\\\"That's good enough for me,\\\" Steve said.\\nA few minutes later, armed with atorifles and their share of the food\\nand water that was left, Steve and Mary set out northward across the\\nsand while the caravan continued east. Fear of what they might find\\nmounted.\\nThe first night, they camped in the lee of low sandhills. The second\\nnight they found a small spring with brackish but drinkable water. On\\nthe third day, having covered half the distance to the Kumaji\\nsettlement, they began to encounter Kumaji patrols, on foot or\\nthlotback\\n, the six-legged desert animals running so swiftly over the\\nsands and so low to the ground that they almost seemed to be gliding.\\nSteve and Mary hardly spoke. Talk was unnecessary. But slowly a bond\\ngrew between them. Steve liked this slim silent girl who had come out\\nhere with him risking her life although she must have known deep in her\\nheart that her father had almost certainly decided to turn traitor in\\norder to regain his fortune.\\nOn the fourth day, they spotted the unicopter from a long way off and\\nmade their way toward it. It had come much further than Steve had\\nexpected. With sinking heart he realized that Tobias Whiting, if he\\nescaped the crash-landing without injury, must surely have reached the\\nKumaji encampment by now.\\n\\\"It doesn't seem badly damaged,\\\" Mary said.\\nThe platform had buckled slightly, the 'copter was tilted over, one of\\nthe rotors twisted, its end buried in sand. Tobias Whiting wasn't there.\\n\\\"No,\\\" Steve said. \\\"It's hardly damaged at all. Your father got out of it\\nall right.\\\"\\n\\\"To go\\u2014to them?\\\"\\n\\\"I think so, Mary. I don't want to pass judgment until we're sure. I'm\\nsorry.\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, Steve! Steve! What will we do? What\\ncan\\nwe do?\\\"\\n\\\"Find him, if it isn't too late. Come on.\\\"\\n\\\"North?\\\"\\n\\\"North.\\\"\\n\\\"And if by some miracle we find him?\\\"\\nSteve said nothing. The answer\\u2014capture or death\\u2014was obvious. But you\\ncouldn't tell that to a traitor's daughter, could you?\\nAs it turned out, they did not find Tobias Whiting through their own\\nefforts. Half an hour after setting out from the unicopter, they were\\nspotted by a roving band of Kumajis, who came streaking toward them on\\ntheir\\nthlots\\n. Mary raised her atorifle, but Steve struck the barrel\\naside. \\\"They'd kill us,\\\" he said. \\\"We can only surrender.\\\"\\nThey were hobbled and led painfully across the sand. They were taken\\nthat way to a small Kumaji encampment, and thrust within a circular\\ntent.\\nTobias Whiting was in there.\\n\\\"Mary!\\\" he cried. \\\"My God! Mary....\\\"\\n\\\"We came for you, Dad,\\\" she said coldly. \\\"To stop you. To ... to kill\\nyou if necessary.\\\"\\n\\\"Mary....\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, Dad, why did you do it? Why?\\\"\\n\\\"We couldn't start all over again, could we? You have a right to live\\nthe sort of life I planned for you. You....\\\"\\n\\\"Whiting,\\\" Steve said, \\\"did you tell them yet?\\\"\\n\\\"No. No, I haven't. I have information to trade, sure. But I want to\\nmake sure it's going to the right people. I want to get our....\\\"\\n\\\"Dad! Our money, and all those deaths?\\\"\\n\\\"It doesn't matter now. I\\u2014I had changed my mind, Mary. Truly. But now,\\nnow that you're a prisoner, what if I don't talk? Don't you see, they'll\\ntorture you. They'll make you talk. And that way\\u2014we get nothing. I\\ncouldn't stand to see them hurt you.\\\"\\n\\\"They can do\\u2014what they think they have to do. I'll tell them nothing.\\\"\\n\\\"You won't have to,\\\" Whiting said. \\\"I'll tell them when we reach the\\nlarger settlement. They're taking us there tomorrow, they told me.\\\"\\n\\\"Then we've got to get out of here tonight,\\\" Steve said.\\nThe low sun cast the shadow of their guard against the\\nthlot\\nskin wall\\nof their tent. He was a single man, armed with a long, pike-like weapon.\\nWhen darkness came, if the guard were not increased....\\nThey were brought a pasty gruel for their supper, and ate in silence and\\ndistaste, ate because they needed the strength. Mary said, \\\"Dad, I don't\\nwant you to tell them anything. Dad, please. If you thought you were\\ndoing it for me....\\\"\\n\\\"I've made up my mind,\\\" Tobias Whiting said.\\nMary turned to Steve, in despair. \\\"Steve,\\\" she said. \\\"Steve.\\nDo\\u2014whatever you have to do. I\\u2014I'll understand.\\\"\\nSteve didn't answer her. Wasn't Whiting right now? he thought. If Steve\\nsilenced him, wouldn't the Kumaji torture them for the information?\\nSteve could stand up to it perhaps\\u2014but he couldn't stand to see them\\nhurt Mary. He'd talk if they did that....\\nThen silencing Whiting wasn't the answer. But the Kumajis had one\\nwilling prisoner and two unwilling ones. They knew that. If the willing\\none yelled for help but the yelling was kept to a minimum so only one\\nguard, the man outside, came....\\nDarkness in the Kumaji encampment.\\nFar off, a lone tribesman singing a chant old as the desert.\\n\\\"Are you asleep?\\\" Mary asked.\\n\\\"No,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"Dad is. Listen to the way he's breathing\\u2014like a baby. As if\\u2014as if he\\nwasn't going to betray all our people. Oh, I hate him, I hate him!\\\"\\nSteve crawled to where the older man was sleeping. Tobias Whiting's\\nvoice surprised him. \\\"I'm not asleep. I was thinking. I\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I'm going to kill you,\\\" Steve said very softly, and sprang at Whiting.\\nHe paused, though. It was a calculated pause, and Whiting cried out as\\nSteve had hoped he would. Then his hands found the older man's throat\\nand closed there\\u2014not to kill him but to keep him from crying out again.\\nSand stirred, the tentflap lifted, and a bulky figure rushed inside.\\nSteve got up, met him halfway, felt the jarring contact of their bodies.\\nThe pike came up dimly in the darkness, the point scraping against\\nSteve's ribs as the guard lunged awkwardly. Steve's fingers sought the\\nthick-muscled neck, clamped there\\u2014squeezing.\\nThe guard writhed. His feet drummed the sand. With one hand he stabbed\\nout wildly with the unwieldy pike. There was a cry from Mary and the\\nguard managed a low squawking noise. Outside, the rest of the camp\\nseemed undisturbed. There was death in Steve's strong tightening\\nfingers. There had to be death there. Death for the Kumaji guard\\u2014or\\ndeath for the fleeing Earthmen, who had lost one colony and must seek\\nanother.\\nThey fell together on the sand, the guard still struggling. Steve\\ncouldn't release his throat to grab the pike. The guard stabbed out\\nawkwardly, blindly with it, kicking up sand. Then Tobias Whiting moaned,\\nbut Steve hardly heard him.\\nWhen the guard's legs stopped drumming, Steve released him. The man was\\neither dead or so close to death that he would be out for hours. Steve\\nhad never killed a man before, had never in violence and with intent to\\nkill attacked a man....\\n\\\"Steve!\\\"\\nIt was Mary, calling his name and crying.\\n\\\"It's Dad. Dad was\\u2014hit. The pike, a wild stab. He's hit bad\\u2014\\\"\\nSteve crawled over to them. It was very dark. He could barely make out\\nTobias Whiting's pain-contorted face.\\n\\\"My stomach,\\\" Whiting said, gasping for breath. \\\"The pain....\\\"\\nSteve probed with his hands, found the wound. Blood was rushing out. He\\ncouldn't stop it and he knew it and he thought Whiting knew it too. He\\ntouched Mary's hand, and held it. Mary sobbed against him, crying\\nsoftly.\\n\\\"You two ...\\\" Whiting gasped. \\\"You two ... Mary, Mary girl. Is\\u2014he\\u2014what\\nyou want?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, Dad. Oh, yes!\\\"\\n\\\"You can get her out of here, Cantwell?\\\"\\n\\\"I think so,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"Then go. Go while you can. I'll tell them\\u2014due south. The Earthmen are\\nheading due south. They'll go\\u2014south. They won't find the caravan.\\nYou'll\\u2014all\\u2014get away. If it's\\u2014what you want, Mary.\\\"\\nShe leaned away from Steve, kissing her father. She asked Steve: \\\"Isn't\\nthere anything we can do for him?\\\"\\nSteve shook his head. \\\"But he's got to live long enough to tell them, to\\ndeceive them.\\\"\\n\\\"I'll live long enough,\\\" Whiting said, and Steve knew then that he\\nwould. \\\"Luck to\\u2014all of you. From a\\u2014very foolish\\u2014man....\\\"\\nSteve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\\nsand to where the\\nthlots\\nwere hobbled for the night. He hardly\\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\\nthlots\\n.\\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\\nthlot's\\nbare back in front of him,\\nand they glided off across the sand.\\nPursuit was disorganized\\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\\nTwo days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\\n\\\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\\\"\\n\\\"We can tell them this,\\\" Steve said. \\\"Your father died a hero's death,\\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\\\"\\n\\\"And not\\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\\\"\\n\\\"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\\nmake a mistake, can't he?\\\"\\n\\\"I love you, Steve. I love you.\\\"\\nThen they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\\nreach Oasis City in safety.\\nWith Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Home is Where You Left It, by Adam Chase\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOME IS WHERE YOU LEFT IT ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 32890-h.htm or 32890-h.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/8/9/32890/\\n\\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\",\n          \"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\\\"\\n    \\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\\\">\\nSaboteur of Space\\nBy ROBERT ABERNATHY\\nFresh power was coming to Earth, energy\\nwhich would bring life to a dying planet.\\nOnly two men stood in its way, one a cowardly\\nrat, the other a murderous martyr; both pawns\\nin a cosmic game where death moved his chessmen\\nof fate\\u2014and even the winner would lose.\\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\\nPlanet Stories Spring 1944.\\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nRyd Randl stood, slouching a little, in the darkened footway, and\\nwatched the sky over Dynamopolis come alive with searchlights. The\\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\\nNow he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\\nup\\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\\nrelief was in sight.\\nRyd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\\ndive.\\nThe place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\\nThe rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\\nRyd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\\nheartened.\\n\\\"Say, Burshis,\\\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\\nthat his jowls quivered.\\n\\\"No loans,\\\" he said flatly. \\\"But just one on the house, Ryd.\\\"\\nThe drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \\\"What you\\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\\u2014\\\"\\nBurshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \\\"Didn't you hear that ship\\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\\u2014the\\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\\nin again.\\\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\\nshoulder: \\\"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\\nJobs for all the bums in this town\\u2014even for you.\\\"\\nHe left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\\nman\\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\\nThe man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \\\"So you're Ryd Randl.\\\"\\nRyd had a bad moment before he saw that the face wasn't that of any\\nplain-clothes man he knew. For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody\\nhe had ever known\\u2014an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a\\nbeak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for\\nthe thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the\\nface, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and\\nalmost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray\\ncellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'.\\n\\\"Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.\\\"\\n\\\"What's the idea?\\\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage\\nfloated to the top by alcohol.\\nThe other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself.\\nHe leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and\\ndistinctly. \\\"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\\\"\\n\\\"\\nHuh?\\nWhy, yeh\\u2014I guess so\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Then come with me.\\\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his\\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\\nmeloderge\\nthat was softly pouring out its\\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\\nOutside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\\nthem. They kept walking\\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\\n\\\"So you're Ryd Randl,\\\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\\n\\\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\\\"\\nRyd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \\\"Look,\\\" he gasped. \\\"If\\nyou're a cop, say so!\\\"\\nThe other laughed shortly. \\\"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\\u2014you\\ncan call me Mury.\\\"\\nRyd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\\neyes.\\n\\\"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\\\"\\n\\\"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\\\"\\n\\\"And why, Ryd?\\\"\\n\\\"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\\\" He hunched his narrow\\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \\\"Damn\\ngood one, too\\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\\nphysique for Mars\\u2014I might just have made it\\nthen\\n, but I thought the\\nplant was going to open again and\\u2014\\\"\\nAnd that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\\nfull economic independence\\u2014and domination. For power is\\u2014power; and\\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\\n\\\"Ten years ago,\\\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \\\"That must have been the\\nPower Company of North America\\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\\\"\\nRyd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \\\"They wouldn't take me, damn\\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\\\"\\n\\\"I know all about your record,\\\" said Mury softly.\\nRyd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\\nkicked-dog manner. \\\"How do you know? And what's it to you?\\\"\\nAll at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\\n\\\"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\\nworking\\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\\ncapitulate frankly to him.\\\"\\nRyd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \\\"Are\\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\\\" he demanded blurrily.\\nMury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\\nsimply, \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't get it,\\\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \\\"The\\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\\nthe arm\\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"To hell with that!\\\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \\\"Don't\\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\\\"\\nRyd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\\n\\\"The power shell is aid, yes\\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\\nconflict, they're selling us out\\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\\nMartian land-owners?\\nDo you?\\n\\\" He paused out of breath; then finished\\nvenomously, \\\"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\\nthan robots\\u2014cheap as\\nslaves\\n!\\\"\\n\\\"What about it?\\\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \\\"What you\\nwant\\nme\\nto do about it?\\\"\\nMury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \\\"We're\\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\\\"\\nRyd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\\n\\\"What's that mean?\\\"\\n\\\"The power shell\\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\\\"\\n\\\"You can't do that.\\\"\\n\\\"\\nWe\\ncan,\\\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \\\"And there\\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\\\"\\nSuspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\\ncertainly\\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\\nWe\\nnever took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\\npanclasm\\u2014that was\\nWe\\n.\\nThe question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\\nan effort, said, \\\"Sure.\\\" A moment later it struck him that the\\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \\\"I got nothing to\\nlose, see?\\\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\\n\\\"You won't lose,\\\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\\nhad come.\\nRyd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\\nhappened....\\nAfter some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\\nwhined, \\\"Where ... where we going now?\\\"\\nMury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\\npointed as Ryd had known he would\\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\\nII\\n\\\"One blow for freedom!\\\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\\nkilled the guard.\\nThe body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\\nHe was caught in the machinery.\\nMury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\\n\\\"All right, Ryd,\\\" he said coolly. \\\"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\\nbrought you this far\\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\\\"\\nThe rest of the way.\\nRyd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\\n\\\"No use now for firearms,\\\" said Mury. \\\"All the guns we could carry\\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\\nminutes\\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\\nShahrazad\\n.\\\"\\nFor a moment Ryd felt relief\\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\\nMury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\\nsmall, disused metal door.\\nRyd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\\nseemed to be crying:\\nrun, run\\n\\u2014but he remembered the power that knew\\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\\nThe lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\\nIt was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\\n\\\"Wait,\\\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\\nThey emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\\nrunways\\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\\nglory\\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\\nof odd ships\\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\\nberthed\\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\\nAs the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\\nmean safety for them.\\nAnd indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\\nNot far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\\u2014watched boredly\\nenough.\\nAnd out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\\nmagnets\\u2014the\\nShahrazad\\n, panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\\n\\\"Relax,\\\" said Mury in a low voice. \\\"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\\naboard the\\nShahrazad\\nwhen she lifts.\\\" For a moment his black eyes\\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\\n\\\"Robots!\\\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\\n\\\"Martian soldier robots!\\\"\\n\\\"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\\nGod's sake, take it easy.\\\"\\nRyd licked dry lips. \\\"Are we going\\u2014out into space?\\\"\\n\\\"Where else?\\\" said Mury.\\nThe official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat\\nhad reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought\\nto question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed\\nguardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards\\nfrom the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was\\u2014as it came\\nabout\\u2014just a little too late.\\nThe guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving\\npair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing\\nuneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle\\nin sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between\\nthe solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other\\nin perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the\\nShahrazad's\\nairlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables\\nattracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety\\nby the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up.\\nThe slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and\\nvanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the\\ntopmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face,\\nbut with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.\\n\\\"Yes?\\\" he inquired frostily.\\n\\\"What goes on here?\\\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure\\nsilhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \\\"The crew's signaled all\\naboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\\\" interrupted\\nthe tall man with asperity. \\\"The City is naturally interested in the\\ndelivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\\\" He paused,\\nsighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \\\"I\\nsuppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\\\"\\nThe guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century\\nbureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod\\nwith an appearance of brusqueness.\\nFully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the\\npompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive\\ninstead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as\\nhe reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun\\nno longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent,\\npointing at its licensed owner.\\n\\\"I think,\\\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the\\nwhile his right held the gun steady, \\\"that you'd better come aboard\\nwith us.\\\"\\nThe guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed\\ncivic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the\\nancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both\\nhands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway\\u2014for he was still very\\nsick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.\\nAbove, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved\\nwall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable\\ncountersunk mirror of metal.\\n\\\"Cover him, Ryd,\\\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out\\nthe heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously\\ntremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his\\nfears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on\\nthe side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.\\nNothing happened.\\n\\\"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\\\" The outer gangway had slid up,\\nthe lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel.\\nMury smiled with supernal calm. \\\"We won't be here long,\\\" he said.\\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \\\"The central control panel and\\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\\\"\\nAlmost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\\n\\\"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\\\"\\nRyd backed\\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\\nnervous gaze\\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\\nHe saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\\noutside.\\nThe inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\\n\\\"You damned clumsy little fool\\u2014\\\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\\nstarboard airlock.\\nMury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \\\"Ready\\\" to\\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\\nlittle cell of steel.\\n\\\"It's been tried before,\\\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\\nex officio\\nthe brains\\nof the vessel. \\\"Stealing a ship\\u2014it can't be done any more.\\\"\\n\\\"It's been done again,\\\" said Mury grimly. \\\"And you don't know the half\\nof it. But\\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\\u2014\\\" The gun\\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \\\"Out of\\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\\\"\\nHe had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\\n\\\"What do you think you're trying to do?\\\"\\n\\\"What do\\nyou\\nthink?\\\" demanded Mury in return. \\\"I'm taking the ship\\ninto space. On schedule and on course\\u2014to meet the power shell.\\\" The\\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \\\"And as for you\\u2014what's your name?\\\"\\n\\\"Yet Arliess.\\\"\\n\\\"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\\\"\\nThe young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \\\"Why, yes,\\\" he\\nsaid as if in wonder, \\\"I do.\\\"\\nIII\\nShahrazad\\ndrove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\\nRyd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\\u2014and Ryd had lost\\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\\nthe towship's keel.\\nA single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\\nengines.\\nMury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\\n\\\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\\\" he said dryly. \\\"That doesn't\\nmean you,\\\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\\nRyd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\\nventured shakily, \\\"Where are we?\\\"\\nMury smiled slightly. \\\"Only our astrogator,\\\" he indicated Arliess,\\nstill masked and fettered, \\\"can tell you that with precision. I\\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\\\"\\nThe other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\\ntracks.\\nMury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\\nlight.\\n\\\"What's that, Arliess?\\\"\\nThe astrogator broke his silence. \\\"A ship.\\\"\\n\\\"I know that well enough. What ship?\\\"\\n\\\"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\\nthat's the liner\\nAlborak\\n, out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\\nfor Mars.\\\"\\nMury shook his head regretfully. \\\"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\\ndrive.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't know what you're talking about,\\\" said Arliess. But his voice\\nwas raw and unsteady.\\n\\\"I'm talking about this.

Before their ships take off, Hind conspires to join her on Number Three or transfer her to Number Four. However, his scheme eventually fails. Before Three lifts off, he sends Dorothy a letter pretending to be Barry\\u2019s imaginary wife from Philadelphia, asking her to stay away from him so his wife and children can still have him. This works for a time in keeping Dorothy away from Barry. Once again, however, Hind\\u2019s scheme ultimately fails once they arrive on Venus and Dorothy is near Barry again. \\nWhile on Number Four, Hind refuses to exit the spaceship to work on the meteor shards, citing his assigned status. When Barry volunteers, Hind is secretly happy, almost as if he wants him out of the picture for good. \\nAfter their arrival on Venus, Dorothy stays away from Barry for a time, but eventually runs into his hospital room and embraces him.

He creates a setting on the island to seem as if it is 1916.

LUDWIG\\nIllustrated by THORNE\\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\\nGalaxy Science Fiction October 1951.\\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nOne man's retreat is another's prison ... and\\nit takes a heap of flying to make a hulk a home!\\nForty days of heaven and forty nights of hell. That's the way it's\\nbeen, Laura. But how can I make you understand? How can I tell you\\nwhat it's like to be young and a man and to dream of reaching the\\nstars? And yet, at the same time, to be filled with a terrible, gnawing\\nfear\\u2014a fear locked in my mind during the day and bursting out like an\\nevil jack-in-the-box at night. I must tell you, Laura.\\nPerhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning....\\nIt was the Big Day. All the examinations, the physicals and psychos,\\nwere over. The Academy, with its great halls and classrooms and\\nlaboratories, lay hollow and silent, an exhausted thing at sleep after\\nspawning its first-born.\\nFor it was June in this year of 1995, and we were the graduating class\\nof the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight.\\nThe\\nfirst\\ngraduating class, Laura. That's why it was so important,\\nbecause we were the\\nfirst\\n.\\nWe sat on a little platform, twenty-five of us. Below us was a beach\\nof faces, most of them strange, shining like pebbles in the warm New\\nMexican sunlight. They were the faces of mothers and fathers and\\ngrandparents and kid brothers and sisters\\u2014the people who a short time\\nago had been only scrawled names on letters from home or words spoken\\nwistfully at Christmas. They were the memory-people who, to me, had\\nnever really existed.\\nBut today they had become real, and they were here and looking at us\\nwith pride in their eyes.\\nA voice was speaking, deep, sure, resonant. \\\"... these boys have worked\\nhard for six years, and now they're going to do a lot of big things.\\nThey're going to bring us the metals and minerals that we desperately\\nneed. They're going to find new land for our colonists, good rich land\\nthat will bear food and be a home for our children. And perhaps most\\nimportant of all, they'll make other men think of the stars and look up\\nat them and feel humility\\u2014for mankind needs humility.\\\"\\nThe speaker was Robert Chandler, who'd brought the first rocket down on\\nMars just five years ago, who'd established the first colony there, and\\nwho had just returned from his second hop to Venus.\\nInstead of listening to his words, I was staring at his broad shoulders\\nand his dark, crew-cut hair and his white uniform which was silk-smooth\\nand skin-tight. I was worshiping him and hating him at the same time,\\nfor I was thinking:\\nHe's already reached Mars and Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and the\\nothers alone! Let us be the first to land somewhere! Let us be the\\nfirst!\\nMickey Cameron, sitting next to me, dug an elbow into my ribs. \\\"I don't\\nsee 'em, Ben,\\\" he whispered. \\\"Where do you suppose they are?\\\"\\nI blinked. \\\"Who?\\\"\\n\\\"My folks.\\\"\\nThat was something I didn't have to worry about. My parents had died in\\na strato-jet crash when I was four, so I hadn't needed many of those\\n\\\"You are cordially invited\\\" cards. Just one, which I'd sent to Charlie\\nTaggart.\\nStardust Charlie, we called him, although I never knew why. He was a\\nveteran of Everson's first trip to the Moon nearly twenty-five years\\nago, and he was still at it. He was Chief Jetman now on the\\nLunar\\nLady\\n, a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White\\nSands.\\nI remembered how, as a kid, I'd pestered him in the Long Island\\nSpaceport, tagging after him like a puppy, and how he'd grown to like\\nme until he became father, mother, and buddy all in one to me. And I\\nremembered, too, how his recommendation had finally made me a cadet.\\nMy gaze wandered over the faces, but I couldn't find Charlie's. It\\nwasn't surprising. The\\nLunar Lady\\nwas in White Sands now, but\\nliberties, as Charlie said, were as scarce as water on Mars.\\nIt doesn't matter\\n, I told myself.\\nThen Mickey stiffened. \\\"I see 'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!\\\"\\nUsually Mickey was the same whether in a furnace-hot engine room or a\\ngarden party, smiling, accepting whatever the world offered. But now a\\ntenseness and an excitement had gripped even him. I was grateful that\\nhe was beside me; we'd been a good team during those final months at\\nthe Academy and I knew we'd be a good team in space. The Universe was\\nmighty big, but with two of us to face it together, it would be only\\nhalf as big.\\nAnd then it seemed that all the proud faces were looking at us as if we\\nwere gods. A shiver went through my body. Though it was daytime, I saw\\nthe stars in my mind's vision, the great shining balls of silver, each\\nlike a voice crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by\\nthe sons of Earth.\\nThey expect a lot from us. They expect us to make a new kind of\\ncivilization and a better place out of Earth. They expect all this and\\na hell of a lot more. They think there's nothing we can't do.\\nI felt very small and very humble. I was scared. Damned scared.\\nAt last it was over, and the proud faces descended upon us in a huge,\\nbabbling wave.\\nThen I saw him. Good old Stardust Charlie.\\nHis wizened little body was shuffling down an aisle, his eyes shining\\nlike a child's. He'd been sandwiched, evidently, in one of the rear\\nrows.\\nBut he wasn't the Charlie I'd seen a year ago. He'd become gaunt and\\nold, and he walked with an unnatural stiffness. He looked so old that\\nit was hard to believe he'd once been young.\\nHe scratched his mop of steel-gray hair and grinned.\\n\\\"You made it, boy,\\\" he chortled, \\\"and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate\\ntonight. Yes, siree, I got twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as\\ngood spacemen should!\\\"\\nThen Mickey strode up to us. He was his normal, boyish self again,\\nwalking lightly, his blond, curly-haired skull swaying as if in rhythm\\nwith some silent melody.\\nAnd you, Laura, were with him.\\n\\\"Meet the Brat,\\\" he said. \\\"My sister Laura.\\\"\\nI stared almost rudely. You were like a doll lost in the immensity\\nof your fluffy pink dress. Your hair was long and transformed into a\\ngolden froth where sunlight touched it. But your eyes were the eyes\\nof a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting a softness, a\\ngentleness that I'd never seen in eyes before.\\n\\\"I'm happy to meet you, Ben,\\\" you said. \\\"I've heard of no one else for\\nthe past year.\\\"\\nA tide of heat crept up from my collar. I stuttered through an\\nintroduction of Charlie.\\nYou and Mickey looked strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old\\nStardust was not a cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie\\nscorned the skin-tight uniforms of the government service and wore a\\nshiny black suit that was a relic of Everson's early-day Moon Patrol.\\nHis tie was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing.\\nAnd the left side of his face was streaked with dark scar tissue, the\\nresult of an atomic blowup on one of the old Moon ships. I was so\\naccustomed to the scars, I was seldom aware of them; but others, I\\nknew, would find them ugly.\\nYou were kind. You shook hands and said, softly: \\\"It's a privilege to\\nmeet you, Charlie. Just think\\u2014one of Everson's men, one of the first\\nto reach the Moon!\\\"\\nCharlie gulped helplessly, and Mickey said: \\\"Still going to spend the\\nweekend with us, aren't you, Ben?\\\"\\nI shook my head. \\\"Charlie has only twenty-four hours liberty. We're\\nplanning to see the town tonight.\\\"\\n\\\"Why don't you both come with us?\\\" you asked. \\\"Our folks have their\\nown plane, so it would be no problem. And we've got a big guest room.\\nCharlie, wouldn't you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the\\nMoon?\\\"\\nCharlie's answer was obscured by a sudden burst of coughing. I knew\\nthat he'd infinitely prefer to spend his liberty sampling Martian\\nfizzes and Plutonian zombies.\\nBut this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration.\\n\\\"We'd really like to come,\\\" I said.\\nOn our way to the 'copter parking field, Dean Dawson passed us. He was\\na tall, willowy man, spectacled, looking the way an academy professor\\nshould look.\\n\\\"Ben,\\\" he called, \\\"don't forget that offer. Remember you've got two\\nmonths to decide.\\\"\\n\\\"No, thanks,\\\" I answered. \\\"Better not count on me.\\\"\\nA moment later Mickey said, frowning, \\\"What was he talking about, Ben?\\nDid he make you an offer?\\\"\\nI laughed. \\\"He offered me a job here at the Academy teaching\\nastrogation. What a life\\nthat\\nwould be! Imagine standing in a\\nclassroom for forty years when I've got the chance to\\u2014\\\"\\nI hesitated, and you supplied the right words: \\\"When you've got the\\nchance to be the first to reach a new planet. That's what most of you\\nwant, isn't it? That's what Mickey used to want.\\\"\\nI looked at you as if you were Everson himself, because you seemed to\\nunderstand the hunger that could lie in a man's heart.\\nThen your last words came back and jabbed me: \\\"That's what Mickey used\\nto want.\\\"\\n\\\"\\nUsed\\nto want?\\\" I asked. \\\"What do you mean?\\\"\\nYou bit your lip, not answering.\\n\\\"What did she mean, Mickey?\\\"\\nMickey looked down at his feet. \\\"I didn't want to tell you yet, Ben.\\nWe've been together a long time, planning to be on a rocket. But\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Yes?\\\"\\n\\\"Well, what does it add up to? You become a spaceman and wear a pretty\\nuniform. You wade through the sands of Mars and the dust of Venus. If\\nyou're lucky, you're good for five, maybe ten years. Then one thing or\\nanother gets you. They don't insure rocketmen, you know.\\\"\\nMy stomach was full of churning, biting ice. \\\"What are you trying to\\nsay, Mickey?\\\"\\n\\\"I've thought about it a long time. They want me for Cargo Supervisor\\nof White Sands Port.\\\" He raised his hand to stop me. \\\"I know. It's not\\nso exciting. I'll just live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben.\\\"\\nI couldn't answer. It was as if someone had whacked the back of my\\nknees with the blast of a jet.\\n\\\"It doesn't change anything, Ben\\u2014right now, I mean. We can still have\\na good weekend.\\\"\\nCharlie was muttering under his breath, smoldering like a bomb about to\\nreach critical mass. I shook my head dazedly at him as we got to the\\n'copter.\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" I said to Mickey, \\\"we can still have a good weekend.\\\"\\nI liked your folks, Laura. There was no star-hunger in them, of course.\\nThey were simple and solid and settled, like green growing things,\\ndeep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were content with a home that was\\ncool on this warm summer night, with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional\\nvideo, and a handsome automatic home that needed no servants or\\nhousework.\\nStardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sand-monkey in a\\nshower, but he tried courageously to be himself.\\nAt the dinner table he stared glassily at nothing and grated, \\\"Only hit\\nMars once, but I'll never forget the kid who called himself a medic.\\nSkipper started coughing, kept it up for three days. Whoopin' cough,\\nthe medic says, not knowin' the air had chemicals that turned to acid\\nin your lungs. I'd never been to Mars before, but I knew better'n that.\\nHell, I says, that ain't whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot.\\\"\\nThat was when your father said he wasn't so hungry after all.\\nAfterward, you and I walked onto the terrace, into the moonlit night,\\nto watch for crimson-tailed continental rockets that occasionally\\nstreaked up from White Sands.\\nWe gazed for a few seconds up into the dark sky, and then you said:\\n\\\"Charlie is funny, isn't he? He's nice and I'm glad he's here, but he's\\nsort of funny.\\\"\\n\\\"He's an old-time spaceman. You didn't need much education in those\\ndays, just a lot of brawn and a quick mind. It took guts to be a\\nspaceman then.\\\"\\n\\\"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?\\\"\\nI smiled and shook my head. \\\"If he had, he never mentioned it. Charlie\\ndoesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as\\nI know, his life began when he took off for the Moon with Everson.\\\"\\nYou stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I knew\\nsuddenly that you liked me, and my heart began to beat faster.\\nThere was silence.\\nYou were lovely, your soft hair like strands of gold, and there were\\nflecks of silver in your dark eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had the\\nfeeling that I shouldn't have come here.\\nYou kept looking at me until I had to ask: \\\"What are you thinking,\\nLaura?\\\"\\nYou laughed, but it was a sad, fearful laugh. \\\"No, I shouldn't be\\nthinking it. You'd hate me if I told you, and I wouldn't want that.\\\"\\n\\\"I could never hate you.\\\"\\n\\\"It\\u2014it's about the stars,\\\" you said very softly. \\\"I understand why you\\nwant to go to them. Mickey and I used to dream about them when we were\\nkids. Of course I was a girl, so it was just a game to me. But once I\\ndreamed of going to England. Oh, it was going to be so wonderful. I\\nlived for months, just thinking about it.\\n\\\"One summer we went. I had fun. I saw the old buildings and castles,\\nand the spaceports and the Channel Tube. But after it was over, I\\nrealized England wasn't so different from America. Places seem exciting\\nbefore you get to them, and afterward they're not really.\\\"\\nI frowned. \\\"And you mean it might be the same with the stars? You think\\nmaybe I haven't grown up yet?\\\"\\nAnxiety darkened your features. \\\"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman,\\nto see the strange places and make history. But is it worth it? Is it\\nworth the things you'd have to give up?\\\"\\nI didn't understand at first, and I wanted to ask, \\\"Give up\\nwhat\\n?\\\"\\nThen I looked at you and the promise in your eyes, and I knew.\\nAll through the years I'd been walking down a single, narrow path.\\nGovernment boarding school, the Academy, my eyes always upward and on\\nthe stars.\\nNow I'd stumbled into a cross-roads, beholding a strange new path that\\nI'd never noticed before.\\nYou can go into space\\n, I thought,\\nand try to do as much living in\\nten years as normal men do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died\\nin a Moon crash at the age of 36, or like a thousand others who lie\\nburied in Martian sand and Venusian dust. Or, if you're lucky, like\\nCharlie\\u2014a kind of human meteor streaking through space, eternally\\nalone, never finding a home.\\nOr there's the other path. To stay on this little prison of an Earth\\nin cool, comfortable houses. To be one of the solid, rooted people with\\na wife and kids. To be one of the people who live long enough to grow\\nold, who awake to the song of birds instead of rocket grumblings, who\\nfill their lungs with the clean rich air of Earth instead of poisonous\\ndust.\\n\\\"I'm sorry,\\\" you said. \\\"I didn't mean to make you sad, Ben.\\\"\\n\\\"It's all right,\\\" I said, clenching my fists. \\\"You made sense\\u2014a lot of\\nsense.\\\"\\nThe next morning Charlie said good-bye in our room. He rubbed his\\nscarred face nervously as he cleared his throat with a series of thin,\\ntight coughs.\\nThen he pointed to a brown, faded tin box lying on the bed. \\\"I'm\\nleavin' that for you. It's full of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. Thought\\nmaybe you'd like to have 'em.\\\"\\nI scowled, not understanding. \\\"Why, Charlie? What for?\\\"\\nHe shrugged as if afraid he might be accused of sentimentality. \\\"Oh,\\nit's just that I've been dodgin' meteors now for twenty-five years.\\nThat's a long time, boy. Ain't one spaceman in a thousand that lucky.\\nSome of these days, I won't be so lucky.\\\"\\nI tried to laugh. \\\"You're good for another twenty-five years, Charlie.\\\"\\nHe shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. \\\"Maybe. Anyway, I'm\\ngonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip to Mars. Tell\\nyou what. There's a little stone cafe on Mars, the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just\\noff Chandler Field on the Grand Canal. When you get to Mars, take a\\nlook inside. I'll probably be there.\\\"\\nHe coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with tears.\\n\\\"Not used to this Earth air,\\\" he muttered. \\\"What I need's some Martian\\nclimate.\\\"\\nSuddenly that cough frightened me. It didn't seem normal. I wondered,\\ntoo, about his stiff movements and glassy stare. It was as if he were\\ndrugged.\\nI shook the thought away. If Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk about\\ngoing to Mars. The medics wouldn't let him go even as far as Luna.\\nWe watched him leave, you and Mickey and I.\\n\\\"When will you be back?\\\" you asked.\\nCharlie's hard face contorted itself into a gargoylish grin. \\\"Maybe a\\ncouple of months, maybe a couple of years. You know spacemen.\\\"\\nThen he waved and strode away, a strange, gray, withered gnome of a man.\\nI wanted him to say something, to tell me the secret that would kill\\nthe doubt worming through my brain.\\nBut he rounded a corner, still grinning and waving, and then he was\\ngone.\\nThat afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more like a boy's\\nroom than a spaceman's. In it were all the little things that kids\\ntreasure\\u2014pennants, models of Everson's two ships, a tennis trophy,\\nbooks, a home-made video.\\nI began to realize how important a room like this could be to a boy.\\nI could imagine, too, the happiness that parents felt as they watched\\ntheir children grow to adulthood.\\nI'd missed something. My folks were shadow-people, my impressions of\\nthem drawn half from ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it\\nhad been a cold, automatic kind of life, the life of dormitories and\\nroutines and rules. I'd been so blinded by the brilliancy of my dreams,\\nI hadn't realized I was different.\\nMy folks were killed in a rocket crash. If it weren't for rockets, I'd\\nhave lived the kind of life a kid should live.\\nMickey noticed my frown.\\n\\\"What's the matter, Ben? Still sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm just\\nnot like you and Charlie, I guess. I\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"No, I understand, Mickey. I'm not sore, really.\\\"\\n\\\"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?\\\"\\n\\\"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the\\nOdyssey\\n, the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want me,\\ntoo, for the Moon Patrol, but that's old stuff, not much better than\\nteaching. I want to be in deep space.\\\"\\n\\\"Well, how about staying with us till you decide? Might as well enjoy\\nEarth life while you can. Okay?\\\"\\nI felt like running from the house, to forget that it existed. I wanted\\nsomeone to tell me one of the old stories about space, a tale of\\ncourage that would put fuel on dying dreams.\\nBut I wanted, also, to be with you, Laura, to see your smile and the\\nflecks of silver in your eyes and the way your nose turned upward ever\\nso slightly when you laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as\\nmuch as I loved the stars.\\nAnd I said, slowly, my voice sounding unfamiliar and far away, \\\"Sure,\\nI'll stay, Mickey. Sure.\\\"\\nForty days of joy, forty nights of fear and indecision. We did all the\\nlittle things, like watching the rockets land at White Sands and flying\\ndown to the Gulf to swim in cool waters. You tried, unsuccessfully, to\\nteach me to dance, and we talked about Everson and Charlie and the Moon\\nand the stars. You felt you had to give the stars all the beauty and\\npromise of a child's dream, because you knew that was what I wanted.\\nOne morning I thought,\\nWhy must I make a choice? Why can't I have both\\nyou and the stars? Would that be asking too much?\\nAll day the thought lay in my mind like fire.\\nThat evening I asked you to marry me. I said it very simply: \\\"Laura, I\\nwant you to be my wife.\\\"\\nYou looked up at Venus, and you were silent for a long while, your face\\nflushed.\\nThen you murmured, \\\"I\\u2014I want to marry you, Ben, but are you asking me\\nto marry a spaceman or a teacher?\\\"\\n\\\"Can't a spaceman marry, too?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, a spaceman can marry, but what would it be like? Don't you see,\\nBen? You'd be like Charlie. Gone for\\nmaybe\\ntwo months,\\nmaybe\\ntwo\\nyears. Then you'd have a twenty-four hour liberty\\u2014and I'd have what?\\\"\\nSomehow I'd expected words like these, but still they hurt. \\\"I wouldn't\\nhave to be a spaceman forever. I could try it for a couple of years,\\nthen teach.\\\"\\n\\\"Would you, Ben? Would you be satisfied with just seeing Mars? Wouldn't\\nyou want to go on to Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus and on and on?\\\"\\nYour voice was choked, and even in the semi-darkness I saw tears\\nglittering in your eyes.\\n\\\"Do you think I'd dare have children, Ben? Mickey told me what happened\\non the\\nCyclops\\n. There was a leak in the atomic engines. The ship was\\nflooded with radiation\\u2014just for a second. It didn't seem serious. The\\nmen had no burns. But a year later the captain had a child. And it\\nwas\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I know, Laura. Don't say it.\\\"\\nYou had to finish. \\\"It was a monster.\\\"\\nThat night I lay awake, the fears and doubts too frantic to let me\\nsleep.\\nYou've got to decide now\\n, I told myself.\\nYou can't stay here. You've\\ngot to make a choice.\\nThe teaching job was still open. The spot on the\\nOdyssey\\nwas still\\nopen\\u2014and the big ship, it was rumored, was equipped to make it all the\\nway to Pluto.\\nYou can take Dean Dawson's job and stay with Laura and have kids and a\\nhome and live to see what happens in this world sixty years from now.\\nOr you can see what's on the other side of the mountain. You can be a\\nline in a history book.\\nI cursed. I knew what Charlie would say. He'd say, \\\"Get the hell out\\nof there, boy. Don't let a fool woman make a sucker out of you. Get\\nout there on the\\nOdyssey\\nwhere you belong. We got a date on Mars,\\nremember? At the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just off Chandler Field on the Grand\\nCanal.\\\"\\nThat's what he'd say.\\nAnd yet I wanted you, Laura. I wanted to be with you, always.\\n\\\"Oh God,\\\" I moaned, \\\"what shall I do?\\\"\\nNext morning the door chimes pealed, and you went to the door and\\nbrought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I wondered who\\ncould be sending me a message.\\nI pressed the stud on the little gray cylinder, and a rasping,\\nautomatic voice droned: \\\"Luna City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret to\\ninform you of death of Charles Taggart, Chief Jetman....\\\"\\nThen there was a Latin name which was more polite than the word\\n\\\"lung-rot\\\" and the metallic phrase, \\\"This message brought to you by\\ncourtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication Corps.\\\"\\nI stood staring at the cylinder.\\nCharles Taggart was dead.\\nCharles Taggart was Charlie. Stardust Charlie.\\nMy heart thudded crazily against my chest. It couldn't be! Not Charlie!\\nThe audiogram had lied!\\nI pressed the stud again. \\\"... regret to inform you of death of\\nCharles ...\\\"\\nI hurled the cylinder at the wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The broken\\nvoice droned on.\\nYou ran to it, shut it off. \\\"I'm sorry, Ben, so terribly\\u2014\\\"\\nWithout answering, I walked into my room. I knew it was true now. I\\nremembered Charlie's coughing, his gaunt features, his drugged gaze.\\nThe metallic words had told the truth.\\nI sat for a long time on my bed, crying inside, but staring dry-eyed at\\nCharlie's faded tin box.\\nThen, finally, I fingered his meager possessions\\u2014a few wrinkled\\nphotos, some letters, a small black statue of a forgotten Martian god,\\na gold service medal from the Moon Patrol.\\nThis was what remained of Charlie after twenty-five years in space.\\nIt was a bitter bargain. A statue instead of a wife, yellowed letters\\ninstead of children, a medal instead of a home.\\nIt'd be a great future\\n, I thought.\\nYou'd dream of sitting in a dingy\\nstone dive on the Grand Canal with sand-wasps buzzing around smoky,\\nstinking candles. A bottle of luchu juice and a couple of Martian girls\\nwith dirty feet for company. And a sudden cough that would be the first\\nsign of lung-rot.\\nTo hell with it!\\nI walked into your living room and called Dean Dawson on the visiphone.\\nI accepted that job teaching.\\nAnd now, Laura, it's nearly midnight. You're in your room, sleeping,\\nand the house is silent.\\nIt's hard to tell you, to make you understand, and that is why I am\\nwriting this.\\nI looked through Charlie's box again, more carefully this time, reading\\nthe old letters and studying the photographs. I believe now that\\nCharlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things so that they\\ncould tell me what he could not express in words.\\nAnd among the things, Laura, I found a ring.\\nA wedding ring.\\nIn that past he never talked about, there was a woman\\u2014his wife.\\nCharlie was young once, his eyes full of dreams, and he faced the same\\ndecision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, but he tried to\\ntravel both. He later learned what we already know\\u2014that there can be\\nno compromise. And you know, too, which path he finally chose.\\nDo you know why he had to drug himself to watch me graduate? So he\\ncould look at me, knowing that I would see the worlds he could never\\nlive to see. Charlie didn't leave just a few trinkets behind him. He\\nleft himself, Laura, for he showed me that a boy's dream can also be a\\nman's dream.\\nHe made his last trip to Luna when he knew he was going to die. Heaven\\nknows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the captain understood and was\\nkind\\u2014but that doesn't matter now.\\nDo you know\\nwhy\\nhe wanted to reach Mars? Do you know why he didn't\\nwant to die in the clean, cool air of Earth?\\nIt was because he wanted to die nearer home. His home, Laura, was the\\nUniverse, where the ship was his house, the crew his father, mother,\\nbrothers, the planets his children.\\nYou say that the beauty of the other side of the mountain vanishes\\nafter you reach it. But how can one ever be\\nsure\\nuntil the journey is\\nmade? Could I or Charlie or the thousand before us bear to look upon a\\nstar and think,\\nI might have gone there; I could have been the first\\n?\\nWe said, too, that the life of a spaceman is lonely. Yet how could one\\nbe lonely when men like Charlie roam the spaceways?\\nCharlie wanted me to himself that night after graduation. He wanted us\\nto celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this would be his\\nlast night on Earth. It might have seemed an ugly kind of celebration\\nto you, but he wanted it with all his heart, and we robbed him of it.\\nBecause of these things, Laura, I will be gone in the morning. Explain\\nthe best you can to Mickey and to your parents and Dean Dawson.\\nRight now I've got a date that I'm going to keep\\u2014at a dingy stone cafe\\non Mars, the\\nSpace Rat\\n, just off Chandler Field on the Grand Canal.\\nStardust Charlie will be there; he'll go with me in memory to whatever\\npart of the Galaxy I may live to reach. And so will you, Laura.\\nI have two wedding rings with me\\u2014his wife's ring and yours.\\n\",\n          \"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\\\"\\n    \\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\\\">\\nThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Home is Where You Left It, by Adam Chase\\n\\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Is the most callous\\ntraitor entitled to mercy? Steve pondered these questions. His decision?\\nThat at times the villain should possibly be spoken of as a hero.\\nOnly the shells of deserted mud-brick houses greeted Steve Cantwell when\\nhe reached the village.\\nHe poked around in them for a while. The desert heat was searing,\\nparching, and the Sirian sun gleamed balefully off the blades of Steve's\\nunicopter, which had brought him from Oasis City, almost five hundred\\nmiles away. He had remembered heat from his childhood here on Sirius'\\nsecond planet with the Earth colony, but not heat like this. It was like\\na magnet drawing all the moisture out of his body.\\nHe walked among the buildings, surprise and perhaps sadness etched on\\nhis gaunt, weather-beaten face. Childhood memories flooded back: the\\nsingle well from which all the families drew their water, the mud-brick\\nhouse, hardly different from the others and just four walls and a roof\\nnow, in which he'd lived with his aunt after his parents had been killed\\nin a\\nKumaji\\nraid, the community center where he'd spent his happiest\\ntime as a boy.\\nHe went to the well and hoisted up a pailful of water. The winch creaked\\nas he remembered. He ladled out the water, suddenly very thirsty, and\\nbrought the ladle to his lips.\\nHe hurled the ladle away. The water was bitter. Not brackish.\\nPoisoned.\\nHe spat with fury, then kneeled and stuffed his mouth with sand, almost\\ngagging. After a while he spat out the sand too and opened his canteen\\nand rinsed his mouth. His lips and mouth were paralyzed by contact with\\nthe poison. He walked quickly across the well-square to his aunt's\\nhouse. Inside, it was dim but hardly cooler. Steve was sweating, the\\nsaline sweat making him blink. He scowled, not understanding. The table\\nwas set in his aunt's house. A coffeepot was on the stove and last\\nnight's partially-consumed dinner still on the table.\\nThe well had been poisoned, the town had been deserted on the spur of\\nthe moment, and Steve had returned to his boyhood home from Earth\\u2014too\\nlate for anything.\\nHe went outside into the square. A lizard was sunning itself and staring\\nat him with lidless eyes. When he moved across the square, the lizard\\nscurried away.\\n\\\"Earthman!\\\" a quavering voice called.\\nSteve ran toward the sound. In the scant shadow of the community center,\\na Kumaji was resting. He was a withered old man, all skin and bones and\\nsweat-stiffened tunic, with enormous red-rimmed eyes. His purple skin,\\nwhich had been blasted by the merciless sun, was almost black.\\nSteve held the canteen to his lips and watched his throat working almost\\nspasmodically to get the water down. After a while Steve withdrew the\\ncanteen and said:\\n\\\"What happened here?\\\"\\n\\\"They're gone. All gone.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, but what happened?\\\"\\n\\\"The Kumaji\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"You're Kumaji.\\\"\\n\\\"This is my town,\\\" the old man said. \\\"I lived with the Earthmen. Now\\nthey're gone.\\\"\\n\\\"But you stayed here\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"To die,\\\" the old man said, without self-pity. \\\"I'm too old to flee, too\\nold to fight, too old for anything but death. More water.\\\"\\nSteve gave him another drink. \\\"You still haven't told me what happened.\\\"\\nActually, though, Steve could guess. With the twenty-second century\\nEarth population hovering at the eleven billion mark, colonies were\\nsought everywhere. Even on a parched desert wasteland like this. The\\nKumaji tribesmen had never accepted the colony as a fact of their life\\non the desert, and in a way Steve could not blame them. It meant one\\noasis less for their own nomadic sustenance. When Steve was a boy,\\nKumaji raids were frequent. At school on Earth and Luna he'd read about\\nthe raids, how they'd increased in violence, how the Earth government,\\nso far away and utterly unable to protect its distant colony, had\\nsuggested withdrawal from the Kumaji desert settlement, especially since\\na colony could exist there under only the most primitive conditions,\\nalmost like the purple-skinned Kumaji natives themselves.\\n\\\"When did it happen?\\\" Steve demanded.\\n\\\"Last night.\\\" It was now midafternoon. \\\"Three folks died,\\\" the Kumaji\\nsaid in his almost perfect English, \\\"from the poisoning of the well. The\\nwell was the last straw. The colonists had no choice. They had to go,\\nand go fast, taking what little water they had left in the houses.\\\"\\n\\\"Will they try to walk all the way through to Oasis City?\\\" Oasis City,\\nbuilt at the confluence of two underground rivers which came to the\\nsurface there and flowed the rest of the way to the sea above ground,\\nwas almost five hundred miles from the colony. Five hundred miles of\\ntrackless sands and hundred-and-thirty-degree heat....\\n\\\"They have to,\\\" the old man said. \\\"And they have to hurry. Men, women\\nand children. The Kumaji are after them.\\\"\\nSteve felt irrational hatred then. He thought it would help if he could\\nfind some of the nomadic tribesmen and kill them. It might help the way\\nhe felt, he knew, but it certainly wouldn't help the fleeing colonists,\\ntrekking across a parched wilderness\\u2014to the safety of Oasis City\\u2014or\\ndeath.\\n\\\"Come on,\\\" Steve said, making up his mind. \\\"The unicopter can hold two\\nin a pinch.\\\"\\n\\\"You're going after them?\\\"\\n\\\"I've got to. They're my people. I've been away too long.\\\"\\n\\\"Say, you're young Cantwell, aren't you? Now I remember.\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, I'm Steve Cantwell.\\\"\\n\\\"I'm not going anyplace, young fellow.\\\"\\n\\\"But you can't stay here, without any good water to drink, without\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I'm staying,\\\" the old man said, still without self-pity, just\\nmatter-of-factly. \\\"The Earth folks have no room for me and I can't blame\\n'em. The Kumaji'll kill me for a renegade, I figure. I lived a good,\\nlong life. I've no regrets. Go after your people, young fellow. They'll\\nneed every extra strong right arm they can get. You got any weapons?\\\"\\n\\\"No,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"Too bad. Well, good-bye and good luck.\\\"\\n\\\"But you can't\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, I'm staying. I want to stay. This is my home. It's the only home\\nI'll ever have. Good luck, young fellow.\\\"\\nSlowly, Steve walked to his unicopter. It was nothing more than a small\\nmetal disk on which to stand, and a shaft with four turbo-blades. It\\ncould do sixty miles an hour at an elevation of two thousand feet.\\nSteve turned the little turbo-jet engine over, then on impulse ran back\\nto the old man and gave him his canteen, turning away before it could be\\nrefused and striding quickly back to the unicopter and getting himself\\nairborne without looking at the deserted village or the old man again.\\nThe old man's voice called after him: \\\"Tell the people ... hurry ...\\nKumaji looking for them to kill ... desert wind ought to wipe out their\\ntrail ... but hurry....\\\"\\nThe voice faded into the faint rushing sound of the hot desert wind.\\nSteve gazed down on bare sun-blasted rock, on rippled dunes, on\\nhate-haze. He circled wider and wider, seeking his people.\\nHours later he spotted the caravan in the immensity of sand and\\nwasteland. He brought the unicopter down quickly, with a rush of air and\\na whine of turbojets. He alighted in the sand in front of the\\nslow-moving column. It was like something out of Earth's Middle\\nEast\\u2014and Middle Ages. They had even imported camels for their life here\\non the Sirian desert, deciding the Earth camel was a better beast of\\nburden than anything the Sirius II wastelands had to offer. They walked\\nbeside the great-humped beasts of burden, the animals piled high with\\nthe swaying baggage of their belongings. They moved through the sands\\nwith agonizing slowness. Already, after only one day's travel, Steve\\ncould see that some of the people were spent and exhausted and had to\\nride on camelback. They had gone perhaps fifteen miles, with almost five\\nhundred to go across searing desert, the Kumaji seeking them....\\n\\\"Hullo!\\\" Steve shouted, and a man armed with an atorifle came striding\\nclumsily through the sand toward him. \\\"Cantwell's the name,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"I'm one of you.\\\"\\nBleak hostility in his face, the man approached. \\\"Cantwell. Yeah, I\\nremember you. Colony wasn't good enough for young Steve Cantwell. Oh,\\nno. Had to go off to Earth to get himself educated. What are you doing\\nhere now on that fancy aircraft of yours, coming to crow at our wake?\\\"\\nThe bitterness surprised Steve. He recognized the man now as Tobias\\nWhiting, who had been the Colony's most successful man when Steve was a\\nboy. Except for his bitterness and for the bleak self-pity and defeat in\\nhis eyes, the years had been good to Tobias Whiting. He was probably in\\nhis mid-forties now, twenty years Steve's senior, but he was\\nwell-muscled, his flesh was solid, his step bold and strong. He was a\\nbig muscular man with a craggy, handsome face. In ten years he had\\nhardly changed at all, while Steve Cantwell, the boy, had become Steve\\nCantwell the man. He had been the Colony's official trader with the\\nKumajis, and had grown rich\\u2014by colony standards\\u2014at his business. Now,\\nSteve realized, all that was behind him, and he could only flee with the\\nothers\\u2014either back to the terribly crowded Earth or on in search of a\\nnew colony on some other outworld, if they could get the transportation.\\nPerhaps that explained his bitterness.\\n\\\"So you've come back, eh? You sure picked a time, Cantwell.\\\"\\nThe refugees were still about a quarter of a mile off, coming up slowly.\\nThey hardly seemed to be moving at all. \\\"Is my aunt all right?\\\" Steve\\nsaid. She was the only family he remembered.\\nTobias Whiting shook his head slowly. \\\"I hate to be the one to tell you\\nthis. Brace yourself for a shock. Your aunt was one of those who died\\nfrom the poisoned water last night.\\\"\\nFor a long moment, Steve said nothing. The only emotion he felt was\\npity\\u2014pity for the hard life his aunt had lived, and the hard death.\\nSadness would come later, if there was to be a time for sadness.\\nThe caravan reached them then. The first person Steve saw was a girl.\\nShe wore the shroud-like desert garment and her face\\u2014it would be a\\npretty face under other circumstances, Steve realized\\u2014was etched with\\nlines of fatigue. Steve did not recognize her. \\\"Who is he, Dad?\\\" the\\ngirl said.\\n\\\"Young Cantwell. Remember?\\\"\\nSo this was Mary Whiting, Steve thought. Why, she'd been a moppet ten\\nyears ago! How old? Ten years old maybe. The years crowded him suddenly.\\nShe was a woman now....\\n\\\"Steve Cantwell?\\\" Mary said. \\\"Of course I remember. Hello, Steve. I\\u2014I'm\\nsorry you had to come back at a time like this. I'm sorry about your\\naunt. If there's anything I can do....\\\"\\nSteve shook his head, then shook the hand she offered him. She was a\\nslim, strong girl with a firm handshake. Her concern for him at a time\\nlike this was little short of amazing, especially since it was\\ncompletely genuine.\\nHe appreciated it.\\nTobias Whiting said: \\\"Shame of it is, Cantwell, some of us could get\\nalong with the Kumaji. I had a pretty good business here, you know\\nthat.\\\" He looked with bitterness at the dusty file of refugees. \\\"But I\\nnever got a credit out of it. Wherever we wind up, my girl and I will be\\npoor again. We could have been rich.\\\"\\nSteve asked, \\\"What happened to all your profits?\\\"\\n\\\"Tied up with a Kumaji moneylender, but thanks to what happened I'll\\nnever see it again.\\\"\\nMary winced, as if her father's words and his self-pity were painful to\\nher. Then others came up and a few minutes were spent in back-pounding\\nand hand-shaking as some of the men who had been boys with Steve came up\\nto recognize and be recognized. Their greeting was warm, as Tobias\\nWhiting's had been cool. Despite the knowledge of what lay behind all of\\nthem, and what still lay ahead, it was a little like homecoming.\\nBut Steve liked Mary Whiting's warm, friendly smile best of all. It was\\ncomforting and reassuring.\\nThree days later, Tobias Whiting disappeared.\\nThe caravan had been making no more than ten or fifteen miles a day.\\nTheir water supply was almost gone but on the fourth day they hoped to\\nreach an oasis in the desert. Two of the older folks had died of\\nfatigue. A third was critically ill and there was little that could be\\ndone for him. The food supply was running short, but they could always\\nslaughter their camels for food and make their way to Oasis City, still\\nfour hundred and some miles away, with nothing but the clothes on their\\nbacks.\\nAnd then, during the fourth night, Tobias Whiting disappeared, taking\\nSteve's unicopter. A sentry had heard the low muffled whine of the\\nturbojets during the night and had seen the small craft take off, but\\nhad assumed Steve had taken it up for some reason. Each day Steve had\\ndone so, reconnoitering for signs of the Kumaji.\\n\\\"But why?\\\" someone asked. \\\"Why?\\\"\\nAt first there was no answer. Then a woman whose husband had died the\\nday before said: \\\"It's no secret Whiting has plenty of money\\u2014with the\\nKumaji.\\\"\\nNone of them looked at Mary. She stood there defiantly, not saying\\nanything, and Steve squeezed her hand.\\n\\\"Now, wait a minute,\\\" one of Whiting's friends said.\\n\\\"Wait, nothing.\\\" This was Jeremy Gort, who twice had been mayor of the\\ncolony. \\\"I know how Whiting's mind works. He slaved all his life for\\nthat money, that's the way he'll see it. Cantwell, didn't you say the\\nKumaji were looking for us, to kill us?\\\"\\n\\\"That's what I was told,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"All right,\\\" Gort went on relentlessly. \\\"Then this is what I figure must\\nhave happened. Whiting got to brooding over his lost fortune and finally\\ndecided he had to have it. So, he went off at night in Cantwell's\\n'copter, determined to get it. Only catch is, folks, if I know the\\nKumaji, they won't just give it to him\\u2014not by a long sight.\\\"\\n\\\"No?\\\" someone asked.\\n\\\"No sir. They'll trade. For our location. And if Whiting went off like\\nthat without even saying good-bye to his girl here, my guess is he'll\\nmake the trade.\\\" His voice reflected some bitterness.\\nMary went to Gort and slapped his face. The elderly man did not even\\nblink. \\\"Well,\\\" he asked her gently, \\\"did your pa tell you he was going?\\\"\\n\\\"N-no,\\\" Mary said. There were tears in her eyes, but she did not cry.\\nGort turned to Steve. \\\"Cantwell, can he get far in that 'copter?\\\"\\nSteve shook his head. \\\"Ten or fifteen miles is all. Almost out of fuel,\\nMr. Gort. You saw how I took her up for only a quick mile swing each\\nday. He won't get far.\\\"\\n\\\"He'll crash in the desert?\\\"\\n\\\"Crash or crash-land,\\\" Steve said.\\nMary sobbed, and bit her lip, and was silent.\\n\\\"We've got to stop him,\\\" Gort said. \\\"And fast. If he gets to the Kumaji,\\nthey'll send down a raiding party and we'll be finished. We could never\\nfight them off without the protection of our village. Near as I can\\nfigure, there's a Kumaji base fifty miles due north of here. Whiting\\nknows it too, so that's where he'll be going, I figure. Can't spare more\\nthan a couple of men to look for him, though, in case the Kumaji find\\nus\\u2014or are led to us\\u2014and attack.\\\"\\nSteve said, \\\"I should have taken something out of the 'copter every\\nnight, so it couldn't start. I'll go.\\\"\\nMary came forward boldly. \\\"I have to go. He's my father. If he crashed\\nout there, he may be hurt. He may be\\u2014dying.\\\"\\nGort looked at her. \\\"And if he's trying to sell us out to the Kumajis?\\\"\\n\\\"Then\\u2014then I'll do whatever Steve asks me to. I promise.\\\"\\n\\\"That's good enough for me,\\\" Steve said.\\nA few minutes later, armed with atorifles and their share of the food\\nand water that was left, Steve and Mary set out northward across the\\nsand while the caravan continued east. Fear of what they might find\\nmounted.\\nThe first night, they camped in the lee of low sandhills. The second\\nnight they found a small spring with brackish but drinkable water. On\\nthe third day, having covered half the distance to the Kumaji\\nsettlement, they began to encounter Kumaji patrols, on foot or\\nthlotback\\n, the six-legged desert animals running so swiftly over the\\nsands and so low to the ground that they almost seemed to be gliding.\\nSteve and Mary hardly spoke. Talk was unnecessary. But slowly a bond\\ngrew between them. Steve liked this slim silent girl who had come out\\nhere with him risking her life although she must have known deep in her\\nheart that her father had almost certainly decided to turn traitor in\\norder to regain his fortune.\\nOn the fourth day, they spotted the unicopter from a long way off and\\nmade their way toward it. It had come much further than Steve had\\nexpected. With sinking heart he realized that Tobias Whiting, if he\\nescaped the crash-landing without injury, must surely have reached the\\nKumaji encampment by now.\\n\\\"It doesn't seem badly damaged,\\\" Mary said.\\nThe platform had buckled slightly, the 'copter was tilted over, one of\\nthe rotors twisted, its end buried in sand. Tobias Whiting wasn't there.\\n\\\"No,\\\" Steve said. \\\"It's hardly damaged at all. Your father got out of it\\nall right.\\\"\\n\\\"To go\\u2014to them?\\\"\\n\\\"I think so, Mary. I don't want to pass judgment until we're sure. I'm\\nsorry.\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, Steve! Steve! What will we do? What\\ncan\\nwe do?\\\"\\n\\\"Find him, if it isn't too late. Come on.\\\"\\n\\\"North?\\\"\\n\\\"North.\\\"\\n\\\"And if by some miracle we find him?\\\"\\nSteve said nothing. The answer\\u2014capture or death\\u2014was obvious. But you\\ncouldn't tell that to a traitor's daughter, could you?\\nAs it turned out, they did not find Tobias Whiting through their own\\nefforts. Half an hour after setting out from the unicopter, they were\\nspotted by a roving band of Kumajis, who came streaking toward them on\\ntheir\\nthlots\\n. Mary raised her atorifle, but Steve struck the barrel\\naside. \\\"They'd kill us,\\\" he said. \\\"We can only surrender.\\\"\\nThey were hobbled and led painfully across the sand. They were taken\\nthat way to a small Kumaji encampment, and thrust within a circular\\ntent.\\nTobias Whiting was in there.\\n\\\"Mary!\\\" he cried. \\\"My God! Mary....\\\"\\n\\\"We came for you, Dad,\\\" she said coldly. \\\"To stop you. To ... to kill\\nyou if necessary.\\\"\\n\\\"Mary....\\\"\\n\\\"Oh, Dad, why did you do it? Why?\\\"\\n\\\"We couldn't start all over again, could we? You have a right to live\\nthe sort of life I planned for you. You....\\\"\\n\\\"Whiting,\\\" Steve said, \\\"did you tell them yet?\\\"\\n\\\"No. No, I haven't. I have information to trade, sure. But I want to\\nmake sure it's going to the right people. I want to get our....\\\"\\n\\\"Dad! Our money, and all those deaths?\\\"\\n\\\"It doesn't matter now. I\\u2014I had changed my mind, Mary. Truly. But now,\\nnow that you're a prisoner, what if I don't talk? Don't you see, they'll\\ntorture you. They'll make you talk. And that way\\u2014we get nothing. I\\ncouldn't stand to see them hurt you.\\\"\\n\\\"They can do\\u2014what they think they have to do. I'll tell them nothing.\\\"\\n\\\"You won't have to,\\\" Whiting said. \\\"I'll tell them when we reach the\\nlarger settlement. They're taking us there tomorrow, they told me.\\\"\\n\\\"Then we've got to get out of here tonight,\\\" Steve said.\\nThe low sun cast the shadow of their guard against the\\nthlot\\nskin wall\\nof their tent. He was a single man, armed with a long, pike-like weapon.\\nWhen darkness came, if the guard were not increased....\\nThey were brought a pasty gruel for their supper, and ate in silence and\\ndistaste, ate because they needed the strength. Mary said, \\\"Dad, I don't\\nwant you to tell them anything. Dad, please. If you thought you were\\ndoing it for me....\\\"\\n\\\"I've made up my mind,\\\" Tobias Whiting said.\\nMary turned to Steve, in despair. \\\"Steve,\\\" she said. \\\"Steve.\\nDo\\u2014whatever you have to do. I\\u2014I'll understand.\\\"\\nSteve didn't answer her. Wasn't Whiting right now? he thought. If Steve\\nsilenced him, wouldn't the Kumaji torture them for the information?\\nSteve could stand up to it perhaps\\u2014but he couldn't stand to see them\\nhurt Mary. He'd talk if they did that....\\nThen silencing Whiting wasn't the answer. But the Kumajis had one\\nwilling prisoner and two unwilling ones. They knew that. If the willing\\none yelled for help but the yelling was kept to a minimum so only one\\nguard, the man outside, came....\\nDarkness in the Kumaji encampment.\\nFar off, a lone tribesman singing a chant old as the desert.\\n\\\"Are you asleep?\\\" Mary asked.\\n\\\"No,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"Dad is. Listen to the way he's breathing\\u2014like a baby. As if\\u2014as if he\\nwasn't going to betray all our people. Oh, I hate him, I hate him!\\\"\\nSteve crawled to where the older man was sleeping. Tobias Whiting's\\nvoice surprised him. \\\"I'm not asleep. I was thinking. I\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I'm going to kill you,\\\" Steve said very softly, and sprang at Whiting.\\nHe paused, though. It was a calculated pause, and Whiting cried out as\\nSteve had hoped he would. Then his hands found the older man's throat\\nand closed there\\u2014not to kill him but to keep him from crying out again.\\nSand stirred, the tentflap lifted, and a bulky figure rushed inside.\\nSteve got up, met him halfway, felt the jarring contact of their bodies.\\nThe pike came up dimly in the darkness, the point scraping against\\nSteve's ribs as the guard lunged awkwardly. Steve's fingers sought the\\nthick-muscled neck, clamped there\\u2014squeezing.\\nThe guard writhed. His feet drummed the sand. With one hand he stabbed\\nout wildly with the unwieldy pike. There was a cry from Mary and the\\nguard managed a low squawking noise. Outside, the rest of the camp\\nseemed undisturbed. There was death in Steve's strong tightening\\nfingers. There had to be death there. Death for the Kumaji guard\\u2014or\\ndeath for the fleeing Earthmen, who had lost one colony and must seek\\nanother.\\nThey fell together on the sand, the guard still struggling. Steve\\ncouldn't release his throat to grab the pike. The guard stabbed out\\nawkwardly, blindly with it, kicking up sand. Then Tobias Whiting moaned,\\nbut Steve hardly heard him.\\nWhen the guard's legs stopped drumming, Steve released him. The man was\\neither dead or so close to death that he would be out for hours. Steve\\nhad never killed a man before, had never in violence and with intent to\\nkill attacked a man....\\n\\\"Steve!\\\"\\nIt was Mary, calling his name and crying.\\n\\\"It's Dad. Dad was\\u2014hit. The pike, a wild stab. He's hit bad\\u2014\\\"\\nSteve crawled over to them. It was very dark. He could barely make out\\nTobias Whiting's pain-contorted face.\\n\\\"My stomach,\\\" Whiting said, gasping for breath. \\\"The pain....\\\"\\nSteve probed with his hands, found the wound. Blood was rushing out. He\\ncouldn't stop it and he knew it and he thought Whiting knew it too. He\\ntouched Mary's hand, and held it. Mary sobbed against him, crying\\nsoftly.\\n\\\"You two ...\\\" Whiting gasped. \\\"You two ... Mary, Mary girl. Is\\u2014he\\u2014what\\nyou want?\\\"\\n\\\"Yes, Dad. Oh, yes!\\\"\\n\\\"You can get her out of here, Cantwell?\\\"\\n\\\"I think so,\\\" Steve said.\\n\\\"Then go. Go while you can. I'll tell them\\u2014due south. The Earthmen are\\nheading due south. They'll go\\u2014south. They won't find the caravan.\\nYou'll\\u2014all\\u2014get away. If it's\\u2014what you want, Mary.\\\"\\nShe leaned away from Steve, kissing her father. She asked Steve: \\\"Isn't\\nthere anything we can do for him?\\\"\\nSteve shook his head. \\\"But he's got to live long enough to tell them, to\\ndeceive them.\\\"\\n\\\"I'll live long enough,\\\" Whiting said, and Steve knew then that he\\nwould. \\\"Luck to\\u2014all of you. From a\\u2014very foolish\\u2014man....\\\"\\nSteve took Mary's hand and pulled her out into the hot, dark, wind-blown\\nnight. He carried the dead Kumaji's pike and they slipped across the\\nsand to where the\\nthlots\\nwere hobbled for the night. He hardly\\nremembered the rest of it. There was violence and death, but necessary\\ndeath. He killed a man with the pike, and unhobbled one of the\\nthlots\\n.\\nThe animal screamed and two more Kumajis came sleepily through the night\\nto see what was the matter. With the long edge of the pike's blade he\\ndecapitated one of them. He slammed the shaft of the weapon across the\\nother's face, probably breaking his jaw. The camp was in a turmoil. In\\nthe darkness he flung Mary on the\\nthlot's\\nbare back in front of him,\\nand they glided off across the sand.\\nPursuit was disorganized\\u2014and unsuccessful. It was too dark for\\neffective pursuit, as Steve had hoped it would be. They rode swiftly all\\nnight and continued riding with the dawn. They could have gone in any\\ndirection. The wind-driven sand would obliterate their trail.\\nTwo days later they reached the caravan. As they rode up, Mary said,\\n\\\"Steve, do you have to tell them?\\\"\\n\\\"We can tell them this,\\\" Steve said. \\\"Your father died a hero's death,\\nsending the Kumajis off in the wrong direction.\\\"\\n\\\"And not\\u2014not what he'd planned to do at first.\\\"\\n\\\"No. We'll tell them that was his intention all the while. A man can\\nmake a mistake, can't he?\\\"\\n\\\"I love you, Steve. I love you.\\\"\\nThen they rode down on the caravan. Somehow Steve knew they would all\\nreach Oasis City in safety.\\nWith Mary he would find a new world out in the vastness of space.\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Home is Where You Left It, by Adam Chase\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HOME IS WHERE YOU LEFT IT ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 32890-h.htm or 32890-h.zip *****\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/8/9/32890/\\n\\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\\n\\n\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\nwill be renamed.\\n\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\npeople in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\",\n          \"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\\\"\\n    \\\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\\\">\\nSaboteur of Space\\nBy ROBERT ABERNATHY\\nFresh power was coming to Earth, energy\\nwhich would bring life to a dying planet.\\nOnly two men stood in its way, one a cowardly\\nrat, the other a murderous martyr; both pawns\\nin a cosmic game where death moved his chessmen\\nof fate\\u2014and even the winner would lose.\\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\\nPlanet Stories Spring 1944.\\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\\nRyd Randl stood, slouching a little, in the darkened footway, and\\nwatched the sky over Dynamopolis come alive with searchlights. The\\nshuttered glow of Burshis' Stumble Inn was only a few yards off to his\\nright, but even that lodestone failed before the novel interest of a\\nship about to ground in the one-time Port of Ten Thousand Ships.\\nNow he made out the flicker of the braking drive a mile or so\\noverhead, and presently soft motor thunder came down to blanket the\\nalmost lightless city with sound. A beam swayed through the throbbing\\ndarkness, caught the descending ship and held it, a small gleaming\\nminnow slipping through the dark heavens. A faint glow rose from Pi\\nMesa, where the spaceport lay above the city, as a runway lighted\\nup\\u2014draining the last reserves of the city's stored power, but draining\\nthem gladly now that, in those autumn days of the historic year 819,\\nrelief was in sight.\\nRyd shrugged limply; the play was meaningless to him. He turned to\\nshuffle down the inviting ramp into the glowing interior of Burshis'\\ndive.\\nThe place was crowded with men and smoke. Perhaps half the former were\\nasleep, on tables or on the floor; but for the few places like Burshis'\\nwhich were still open under the power shortage, many would have frozen,\\nthese days, in the chilly nights at fourteen thousand feet. For\\nDynamopolis sprawled atop the world, now as in the old days when it had\\nbeen built to be the power center of North America.\\nThe rocket blasts crescendoed and died up on Pi Mesa as Ryd wedged\\nhimself with difficulty into the group along the bar. If anyone\\nrecognized him, they showed it only by looking fixedly at something\\nelse. Only Burshis Yuns kept his static smile and nodded with\\nsurprising friendliness at Ryd's pinched, old-young face.\\nRyd was startled by the nod. Burshis finished serving another customer\\nand maneuvered down the stained chrome-and-synthyl bar. Ryd was\\nheartened.\\n\\\"Say, Burshis,\\\" he started nervously, as the bulky man halted with his\\nback to him. But Burshis turned, still smiling, shaking his head so\\nthat his jowls quivered.\\n\\\"No loans,\\\" he said flatly. \\\"But just one on the house, Ryd.\\\"\\nThe drink almost spilled itself in Ryd's hand. Clutching it\\nconvulsively, he made his eyes narrow and said suspiciously, \\\"What you\\nsetting 'em up for, Burshis? It's the first time since\\u2014\\\"\\nBurshis' smile stayed put. He said affably, \\\"Didn't you hear that ship\\nthat just came down on the Mesa? That was the ship from Mars\\u2014the\\nescort they were sending with the power cylinder. The power's coming\\nin again.\\\" He turned to greet a coin-tapping newcomer, added over his\\nshoulder: \\\"You know what that means, Ryd. Some life around here again.\\nJobs for all the bums in this town\\u2014even for you.\\\"\\nHe left Ryd frowning, thinking fuzzily. A warming gulp seemed to clear\\nhis head. Jobs. So they thought they could put that over on him again,\\nhuh? Well, he'd show them. He was smart; he was a damn good helio\\nman\\u2014no, that had been ten years ago. But now he was out of the habit\\nof working, anyway. No job for Ryd Randl. They gave him one once and\\nthen took it away. He drank still more deeply.\\nThe man on Ryd's immediate right leaned toward him. He laid a hand on\\nhis arm, gripping it hard, and said quietly: \\\"So you're Ryd Randl.\\\"\\nRyd had a bad moment before he saw that the face wasn't that of any\\nplain-clothes man he knew. For that matter, it didn't belong to anybody\\nhe had ever known\\u2014an odd, big-boned face, strikingly ugly, with a\\nbeak-nose that was yet not too large for the hard jaw or too bleak for\\nthe thin mouth below it. An expensive transparent hat slanted over the\\nface, and from its iridescent shadows gleamed eyes that were alert and\\nalmost frighteningly black. Ryd noted that the man wore a dark-gray\\ncellotex of a sort rarely seen in joints like Burshis'.\\n\\\"Suppose we step outside, Ryd. I'd like to talk to you.\\\"\\n\\\"What's the idea?\\\" demanded Ryd, his small store of natural courage\\nfloated to the top by alcohol.\\nThe other seemed to realize that he was getting ahead of himself.\\nHe leaned back slightly, drew a deep breath, and said slowly and\\ndistinctly. \\\"Would you care to make some money, my friend?\\\"\\n\\\"\\nHuh?\\nWhy, yeh\\u2014I guess so\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"Then come with me.\\\" The hand still on his arm was insistent. In his\\ndaze, Ryd let himself be drawn away from the bar into the sluggish\\ncrowd; then he suddenly remembered his unfinished drink, and made\\nfrantic gestures. Deliberately misunderstanding, the tall stranger\\nfumbled briefly, tossed a coin on the counter-top, and hustled Ryd out,\\npast the blue-and-gold-lit\\nmeloderge\\nthat was softly pouring out its\\nendlessly changing music, through the swinging doors into the dark.\\nOutside, between lightless buildings, the still cold closed in on\\nthem. They kept walking\\u2014so fast that Ryd began to lose his breath,\\nlong-accustomed though his lungs were to the high, thin air.\\n\\\"So you're Ryd Randl,\\\" repeated the stranger after a moment's silence.\\n\\\"I might have known you. But I'd almost given up finding you tonight.\\\"\\nRyd tried feebly to wrench free, stumbled. \\\"Look,\\\" he gasped. \\\"If\\nyou're a cop, say so!\\\"\\nThe other laughed shortly. \\\"No. I'm just a man about to offer you a\\nchance. For a come-back, Ryd\\u2014a chance to live again.... My name\\u2014you\\ncan call me Mury.\\\"\\nRyd was voiceless. Something seemed increasingly ominous about the\\ntall, spare man at his side. He wished himself back in Burshis' with\\nhis first free drink in a month. The thought of it brought tears to his\\neyes.\\n\\\"How long have you been out of a job, Ryd?\\\"\\n\\\"Nine ... ten years. Say, what's it to you?\\\"\\n\\\"And why, Ryd?\\\"\\n\\\"Why...? Look, mister, I was a helio operator.\\\" He hunched his narrow\\nshoulders and spread his hands in an habitual gesture of defeat. \\\"Damn\\ngood one, too\\u2014I was a foreman ten years ago. But I don't have the\\nphysique for Mars\\u2014I might just have made it\\nthen\\n, but I thought the\\nplant was going to open again and\\u2014\\\"\\nAnd that was it. The almost airless Martian sky, with its burning\\nactinic rays, is so favorable for the use of the helio-dynamic engine.\\nAnd after the middle of the eighth century, robot labor gave Mars its\\nfull economic independence\\u2014and domination. For power is\\u2014power; and\\nthere is the Restriction Act to keep men on Earth even if more than two\\nin ten could live healthily on the outer world.\\n\\\"Ten years ago,\\\" Mury nodded as if satisfied. \\\"That must have been the\\nPower Company of North America\\u2014the main plant by Dynamopolis itself,\\nthat shut down in December, 809. They were the last to close down\\noutside the military bases in the Kun Lun.\\\"\\nRyd was pacing beside him now. He felt a queer upsurge of confidence in\\nthis strange man; for too long he had met no sympathy and all too few\\nmen who talked his language. He burst out: \\\"They wouldn't take me, damn\\nthem! Said my record wasn't good enough for them. That is, I didn't\\nhave a drag with any of the Poligerents.\\\"\\n\\\"I know all about your record,\\\" said Mury softly.\\nRyd's suspicions came back abruptly, and he reverted to his old\\nkicked-dog manner. \\\"How do you know? And what's it to you?\\\"\\nAll at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\\n\\\"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd\\u2014you mean nothing at all to me as an\\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\\nworking\\u2014the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\\ncapitulate frankly to him.\\\"\\nRyd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \\\"Are\\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\\\" he demanded blurrily.\\nMury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\\nsimply, \\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't get it,\\\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \\\"The\\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\\nthe arm\\u2014no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"To hell with that!\\\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \\\"Don't\\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\\\"\\nRyd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\\n\\\"The power shell is aid, yes\\u2014but with what a price! It's the thirty\\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\\nconflict, they're selling us out\\u2014making Earth, the first home of man,\\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\\nMartian land-owners?\\nDo you?\\n\\\" He paused out of breath; then finished\\nvenomously, \\\"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\\nthan robots\\u2014cheap as\\nslaves\\n!\\\"\\n\\\"What about it?\\\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \\\"What you\\nwant\\nme\\nto do about it?\\\"\\nMury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \\\"We're\\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\\\"\\nRyd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\\n\\\"What's that mean?\\\"\\n\\\"The power shell\\u2014isn't coming in as planned.\\\"\\n\\\"You can't do that.\\\"\\n\\\"\\nWe\\ncan,\\\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \\\"And there\\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\\\"\\nSuspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\\ncertainly\\u2014if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\\nWe\\nnever took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\\npanclasm\\u2014that was\\nWe\\n.\\nThe question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\\nan effort, said, \\\"Sure.\\\" A moment later it struck him that the\\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \\\"I got nothing to\\nlose, see?\\\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\\n\\\"You won't lose,\\\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\\nhad come.\\nRyd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\\nhappened....\\nAfter some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\\nwhined, \\\"Where ... where we going now?\\\"\\nMury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\\npointed as Ryd had known he would\\u2014toward where a pale man-made dawn\\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\\nII\\n\\\"One blow for freedom!\\\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\\nkilled the guard.\\nThe body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\\nHe was caught in the machinery.\\nMury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\\n\\\"All right, Ryd,\\\" he said coolly. \\\"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\\nbrought you this far\\u2014you're taking me the rest of the way.\\\"\\nThe rest of the way.\\nRyd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\\n\\\"No use now for firearms,\\\" said Mury. \\\"All the guns we could carry\\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\\nminutes\\u2014when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\\nShahrazad\\n.\\\"\\nFor a moment Ryd felt relief\\u2014he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\\nMury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\\nsmall, disused metal door.\\nRyd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\\nseemed to be crying:\\nrun, run\\n\\u2014but he remembered the power that knew\\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\\nThe lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\\nIt was still musty in the narrow passage, between the closely-pressing\\nwalls, beneath the great tubes and cable sheathings that fluted the\\nceiling overhead. A stairway spiraled up on the right to the control\\ncupola somewhere overhead; even in the airtight gallery a thin film\\nof dust lay on every step. Up there were the meters and switches of\\nthe disused terminal facilities of the spaceport; beyond the metal\\ndoor marked CAUTION, just beyond the stairwell, lay the long runway\\ndown which the ships of space had glided to be serviced, refueled, and\\nlaunched into the sky once more by now dormant machines.\\n\\\"Wait,\\\" said Mury succinctly; he vanished up the spiral stair, his\\nlong legs taking two steps at a time. After an aching minute's silence,\\nhe was back. All was clear as seen from the turret-windows overhead.\\nThey emerged in shadow, hugging the wall. Almost a quarter of a mile to\\nthe right the megalith of the Communications Tower, crowned with many\\nlights where the signal-men sat godlike in its summit. Its floodlights\\nshed a vast oval of light out over the mesa, where the mile-long\\nrunways\\u2014no longer polished mirror-like as in the days of Dynamopolis'\\nglory\\u2014stretched away into the darkness of the table land. A handful\\nof odd ships\\u2014mere remnant of the hundreds that Pi Mesa port had\\nberthed\\u2014huddled under the solenoid wickets, as if driven together by\\nthe chill of the thin, knife-like wind that blew across the mesa.\\nAs the two paced slowly across the runways, Ryd had a sense of\\nprotective isolation in the vast impersonality of the spaceport.\\nSurely, in this Titanic desolation of metal slabs and flat-roofed\\nbuildings, dominated by the one great tower, total insignificance must\\nmean safety for them.\\nAnd indeed no guard challenged them. There were armed men watching\\nfor all intruders out on the desert beyond the runways, but once\\ninside, Ryd's borrowed blue seemed to serve as passport enough.\\nNonetheless, the passport's knees were shaking when they stood at last,\\ninconspicuous still, at the shadowed base of the Communications Tower.\\nNot far off, a half-dozen dignitaries, huddled close together in the\\nmidst of these Cyclopean man-made things that dwarfed their policies,\\ntheir principles and ambitions, stood talking rather nervously with two\\nofficers, aristocratically gaudy in the scarlet of the Martian Fleet.\\nBlue-clad guardsmen of Earth watched from a distance\\u2014watched boredly\\nenough.\\nAnd out on the steel-stripped tarmac, under the solenoid of Number\\nTwo Runway, lay a towship, backed like a stegosaur with its massive\\nmagnets\\u2014the\\nShahrazad\\n, panting like a dragon amid rolling clouds of\\nsteam. She was plainly ready to go into space. The bottom dropped out\\nof Ryd's stomach before he realized that a warning at least must be\\nsounded before the ship could lift. But that might come any moment now.\\n\\\"Relax,\\\" said Mury in a low voice. \\\"Nothing's gone wrong. We'll be\\naboard the\\nShahrazad\\nwhen she lifts.\\\" For a moment his black eyes\\nshifted, hardening, toward Runway Four. The Martian warship lay there\\nbeyond the solenoid, a spiteful hundred-foot swordfish of steel, with\\nblind gunvalves, row on row, along its sleek sides and turret-blisters.\\nIt had not yet been tugged onto the turntable; it could not be leaving\\nagain very soon, though Earth weight was undoubtedly incommoding\\nits crew. About it a few figures stood that were stiffly erect and\\nimmobile, as tall as tall men. From head to toe they were scarlet.\\n\\\"Robots!\\\" gasped Ryd, clutching his companion's arm convulsively.\\n\\\"Martian soldier robots!\\\"\\n\\\"They're unarmed, harmless. They aren't your police with built-in\\nweapons. Only the humans are dangerous. But we've got to move. For\\nGod's sake, take it easy.\\\"\\nRyd licked dry lips. \\\"Are we going\\u2014out into space?\\\"\\n\\\"Where else?\\\" said Mury.\\nThe official-looking individual in the expensive topcoat and sport hat\\nhad reached the starboard airlock of the towship before anyone thought\\nto question his authorization, escorted as he was by a blue-uniformed\\nguardsman. When another sentry, pacing between runways a hundred yards\\nfrom the squat space vessel, paused to wonder, it was\\u2014as it came\\nabout\\u2014just a little too late.\\nThe guard turned and swung briskly off to intercept the oddly-behaving\\npair, hand crowding the butt of his pistol, for he was growing\\nuneasy. His alarm mounted rapidly, till he nearly sprained an ankle\\nin sprinting across the last of the two intervening runways, between\\nthe solenoid wickets. Those metal arches, crowding one on the other\\nin perspective, formed a tunnel that effectively shielded the\\nShahrazad's\\nairlocks from more distant view; the gang of notables\\nattracted by the occasion was already being shepherded back to safety\\nby the Communications guards, whose attention was thus well taken up.\\nThe slight man in guardsman's blue glanced over his shoulder and\\nvanished abruptly into the circular lock. His companion wheeled on the\\ntopmost step, looking down with some irritation on his unhandsome face,\\nbut with no apparent doubt of his command of the situation.\\n\\\"Yes?\\\" he inquired frostily.\\n\\\"What goes on here?\\\" snapped the guard, frowning at the tall figure\\nsilhouetted against the glow in the airlock. \\\"The crew's signaled all\\naboard and the ship lifts in two minutes. You ought to be\\u2014\\\"\\n\\\"I am Semul Mury, Poligerent for the City of Dynamopolis,\\\" interrupted\\nthe tall man with asperity. \\\"The City is naturally interested in the\\ndelivery of the power which will revivify our industries.\\\" He paused,\\nsighed, shifting his weight to the next lower step of the gangway. \\\"I\\nsuppose you'll want to re-check my credentials?\\\"\\nThe guard was somewhat confused; a Poligerent, in ninth-century\\nbureaucracy, was a force to be reckoned with. But he contrived to nod\\nwith an appearance of brusqueness.\\nFully expecting official papers, signed and garnished with all the\\npompous seals of a chartered metropolis, the guard was dazed to receive\\ninstead a terrific left-handed foul to the pit of the stomach, and as\\nhe reeled dizzily, retching and clawing for his gun, to find that gun\\nno longer holstered but in the hand of the self-styled Poligerent,\\npointing at its licensed owner.\\n\\\"I think,\\\" Mury said quietly, flexing his left wrist with care the\\nwhile his right held the gun steady, \\\"that you'd better come aboard\\nwith us.\\\"\\nThe guard was not more cowardly than the run of politically-appointed\\ncivic guardsmen. But a flame gun kills more frightfully than the\\nancient electric chair. He complied, grasping the railing with both\\nhands as he stumbled before Mury up the gangway\\u2014for he was still very\\nsick indeed, wholly apart from his bewilderment, which was enormous.\\nAbove, Ryd Randl waited in the lock, flattened against the curved\\nwall, white and jittering. The inner door was shut, an impenetrable\\ncountersunk mirror of metal.\\n\\\"Cover him, Ryd,\\\" ordered Mury flatly. In obedience Ryd lugged out\\nthe heavy flame pistol and pointed it; his finger was dangerously\\ntremulous on the firing lever. He moistened his lips to voice his\\nfears; but Mury, pocketing the other gun, threw the three-way switch on\\nthe side panel, the switch that should have controlled the inner lock.\\nNothing happened.\\n\\\"Oh, God. We're caught. We're trapped!\\\" The outer gangway had slid up,\\nthe lock wheezed shut, forming an impenetrable crypt of niosteel.\\nMury smiled with supernal calm. \\\"We won't be here long,\\\" he said.\\nThen, to quiet Ryd's fears, he went on: \\\"The central control panel and\\nthe three local switches inside, between, and outside the locks are\\non the circuit in that order. Unless the locks were closed from the\\nswitch just beyond the inner lock, that lock will open when the central\\ncontrol panel is cut out in preparation for lifting.\\\"\\nAlmost as he paused and drew breath, a light sprang out over the switch\\nhe had closed and the inner lock swung silently free of its gaskets.\\nRyd felt a trembling relief; but Mury's voice lashed out like a whip as\\nhe slipped cat-like into the passage.\\n\\\"Keep him covered. Back out of the lock.\\\"\\nRyd backed\\u2014the white, tense face of the prisoner holding his own\\nnervous gaze\\u2014and, almost out of the lock, stumbled over the metal\\npressure rings. And the gun was out of his unsure grip, clattering\\nsomewhere near his slithering feet, as he started to fall.\\nHe saw the guardsman hurl himself forward; then he was flung spinning,\\nback against the engine-room door. In a flash, even as he struggled\\nto keep on his feet, he saw the man in the airlock coming up from a\\ncrouch, shifting the pistol in his right hand to reach its firing\\nlever; he saw Mury sidestep swiftly and throw the master control switch\\noutside.\\nThe inner lock whooshed shut, barely missing Ryd. At the same instant,\\nthe flame gun lighted locks and passage with one terrific flash, and a\\nscorched, discolored spot appeared on the beveled metal of the opposite\\nlock a foot from Mury's right shoulder.\\n\\\"You damned clumsy little fool\\u2014\\\" said Mury with soft intensity. Then,\\nwhile the air around the metal walls still buzzed and snapped with\\nblue sparks, he whirled and went up the control-room gangway in two\\nquick bounds. Even as he went the flame gun thundered again in the\\nstarboard airlock.\\nMury was just in time, for the pilot had been about to flash \\\"Ready\\\" to\\nthe Communications Tower when the explosions had given him pause. But\\nthe latter and his two companions were neither ready nor armed; clamped\\nin their seats at the controls, already marked, they were helpless in\\nan instant before the leveled menace of the gun. And the imprisoned\\nguardsman, having wasted most of his charges, was helpless, too, in his\\nlittle cell of steel.\\n\\\"It's been tried before,\\\" said one of the masked men. He had a blond,\\nyouthful thatch and a smooth healthy face below the mask, together with\\nan astrogator's triangled stars which made him\\nex officio\\nthe brains\\nof the vessel. \\\"Stealing a ship\\u2014it can't be done any more.\\\"\\n\\\"It's been done again,\\\" said Mury grimly. \\\"And you don't know the half\\nof it. But\\u2014you will. I'll need you. As for your friends\\u2014\\\" The gun\\nmuzzle shifted slightly to indicate the pilot and the engineer. \\\"Out of\\nthose clamps. You're going to ride this out in the portside airlock.\\\"\\nHe had to repeat the command, in tones that snapped with menace, before\\nthey started with fumbling, rebellious hands to strip their armor from\\nthemselves. The burly engineer was muttering phrases of obscene fervor;\\nthe weedy young pilot was wild-eyed. The blond astrogator, sitting\\nstill masked and apparently unmoved, demanded:\\n\\\"What do you think you're trying to do?\\\"\\n\\\"What do\\nyou\\nthink?\\\" demanded Mury in return. \\\"I'm taking the ship\\ninto space. On schedule and on course\\u2014to meet the power shell.\\\" The\\nflame gun moved with a jerk. \\\"And as for you\\u2014what's your name?\\\"\\n\\\"Yet Arliess.\\\"\\n\\\"You want to make the trip alive, don't you, Yet Arliess?\\\"\\nThe young astrogator stared at him and at the gun through masking\\ngoggles; then he sank into his seat with a slow shudder. \\\"Why, yes,\\\" he\\nsaid as if in wonder, \\\"I do.\\\"\\nIII\\nShahrazad\\ndrove steadily forward into deep space, vibrating slightly\\nto the tremendous thrust of her powerful engines. The small, cramped\\ncabin was stiflingly hot to the three armored men who sat before its\\nbanked dials, watching their steady needles.\\nRyd had blacked out, darkness washing into his eyes and consciousness\\ndraining from his head, as the space ship had pitched out into\\nemptiness over the end of the runway on Pi Mesa and Mury had cut in the\\nmaindrive. Pressure greater than anything he had ever felt had crushed\\nhim; his voice had been snatched from his lips by those terrible forces\\nand lost beneath the opening thunder of the three-inch tubes. Up and\\nup, while the acceleration climbed to seven gravities\\u2014and Ryd had lost\\nevery sensation, not to regain them until Earth was dropping away under\\nthe towship's keel.\\nA single gravity held them back and down in the tilted seats, and the\\ncontrol panels seemed to curve half above them, their banks of lights\\nconfused with the stars coldly through the great nose window. In the\\ncontrol room all sounds impinged on a background made up of the insect\\nhum of air-purifiers, the almost supersonic whine of the fast-spinning\\ngyroscopes somewhere behind them, the deep continuous growl of the\\nengines.\\nMury's voice broke through that steady murmur, coming from Ryd's right.\\n\\\"You can unfasten your anticlamps, Ryd,\\\" he said dryly. \\\"That doesn't\\nmean you,\\\" to the young navigator, on his other hand as he sat in\\nthe pilot's seat with his pressure-clamps thrown back and his gloved\\nhands free to caress the multiplex controls before him. Clipped to the\\nsloping dash at his left elbow was a loaded flame gun.\\nRyd emerged, with much bungling, from his padded clamps, and shook his\\nhead groggily as he ran a hand through his slightly thinning hair. He\\nventured shakily, \\\"Where are we?\\\"\\nMury smiled slightly. \\\"Only our astrogator,\\\" he indicated Arliess,\\nstill masked and fettered, \\\"can tell you that with precision. I\\nunderstand only enough of astrogational practice to make sure that he\\nis holding to the course outlined on the log. For that matter ... he\\nis an intelligent young man and if he were not blinded by notions of\\nduty to an outworn system.... We are now somewhere near the orbit of\\nthe Moon. Isn't that right, Arliess?\\\"\\nThe other did not seem to hear; he sat staring blindly before him\\nthrough his goggles at the slowly-changing chart, where cryptic lights\\nburned, some moving like glowing paramecia along fine-traced luminous\\ntracks.\\nMury too sat silent and immobile for a minute or more. Then, abruptly,\\nhe inclined his universal chair far to the right, and his long frame\\nseemed to tense oddly. His finger stabbed out one of the sparks of\\nlight.\\n\\\"What's that, Arliess?\\\"\\nThe astrogator broke his silence. \\\"A ship.\\\"\\n\\\"I know that well enough. What ship?\\\"\\n\\\"I supposed you had examined the log. It would have told you that\\nthat's the liner\\nAlborak\\n, out of Aeropolis with a diplomatic mission\\nfor Mars.\\\"\\nMury shook his head regretfully. \\\"That won't wash, Arliess. Even if you\\nsuppose her off course, no liner aspace ever carried a tenth of that\\ndrive.\\\"\\n\\\"I don't know what you're talking about,\\\" said Arliess. But his voice\\nwas raw and unsteady.\\n\\\"I'm talking about this.
